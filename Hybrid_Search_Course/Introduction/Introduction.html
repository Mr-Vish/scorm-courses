<h1>Building AI-Powered Search with Hybrid Retrieval</h1>

<div class="intro-section">
<h2>Course Overview</h2>
<p>Welcome to <strong>Building AI-Powered Search with Hybrid Retrieval</strong>. Modern search systems require more than traditional keyword matching or semantic understanding alone. This course teaches you how to build production-grade search systems that combine multiple retrieval strategies to deliver superior results.</p>

<p>You'll learn to implement hybrid search architectures that leverage both BM25 keyword search and vector-based semantic search, understand query processing with LLMs, and master advanced techniques like re-ranking and faceted search.</p>

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
<p>By the end of this course, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand the strengths and limitations of keyword search (BM25) versus vector search</li>
<li>Implement Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) to combine multiple search result sets</li>
<li>Build hybrid search queries using modern search engines like Elasticsearch</li>
<li>Apply query understanding techniques using Large Language Models (LLMs)</li>
<li>Implement multi-query retrieval strategies for improved recall</li>
<li>Design and deploy re-ranking pipelines with cross-encoders</li>
<li>Integrate AI-enhanced faceted search into production systems</li>
<li>Architect complete search pipelines from indexing to response generation</li>
</ul>

<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>This course is designed for:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Backend Engineers:</strong> Building search and retrieval systems</li>
<li><strong>ML Engineers:</strong> Implementing RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipelines</li>
<li><strong>Data Engineers:</strong> Designing information retrieval architectures</li>
<li><strong>Product Engineers:</strong> Enhancing search experiences in applications</li>
</ul>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>To get the most out of this course, you should have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic understanding of Python programming</li>
<li>Familiarity with REST APIs and JSON</li>
<li>Basic knowledge of machine learning concepts (embeddings, models)</li>
<li>Experience with at least one search engine (Elasticsearch, OpenSearch, or similar) is helpful but not required</li>
</ul>

<h2>What You'll Learn</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Module 1:</strong> Hybrid Search Fundamentals - BM25, Vector Search, and Fusion Strategies</li>
<li><strong>Module 2:</strong> Advanced Query Processing and Re-ranking</li>
<li><strong>Module 3:</strong> Production Architecture and Best Practices</li>
</ul>

<h2>Course Structure</h2>
<p>This course contains <strong>3 modules</strong> with <strong>7 content pages</strong>,
followed by assessments to test your understanding. Each module includes practical code examples and real-world scenarios. You need to score 70% or higher on each assessment to proceed.</p>

<h2>How to Navigate</h2>
<p>Use the <strong>Next</strong> and <strong>Previous</strong> buttons at the bottom right to move through the course.
Your progress is saved automatically, so you can resume where you left off if you exit and return later.</p>

<h2>Expected Time Commitment</h2>
<p>Plan to spend approximately <strong>3-4 hours</strong> completing this course, including reading content, reviewing code examples, and completing assessments.</p>
