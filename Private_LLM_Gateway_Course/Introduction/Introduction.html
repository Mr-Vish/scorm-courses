<h1>Introduction to Private LLM Gateways</h1>

<div class="intro-section">
<p>As enterprises race to adopt Generative AI, they face a critical challenge: how to provide their employees and applications with access to powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) while maintaining strict security, privacy, and compliance standards. A <strong>Private LLM Gateway</strong> is the essential architectural component that solves this problem.</p>

<p>A Private LLM Gateway acts as a secure, centralized entry point for all AI requests within an organization. It sits between internal users/applications and external AI providers (like OpenAI, Anthropic, or Azure), providing a layer of control, visibility, and protection that is not possible with direct API access.</p>

<h2>Why Your Organization Needs a Private Gateway</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Data Protection:</strong> Automatically scan and redact Personally Identifiable Information (PII) before it ever leaves your internal network.</li>
    <li><strong>Access Control:</strong> Use your organization's existing Identity Provider (IDP) to manage who can access which models and at what cost.</li>
    <li><strong>Cost Management:</strong> Implement global and per-user budgets to prevent unexpected AI spend.</li>
    <li><strong>Compliance and Auditing:</strong> Maintain a complete, immutable log of every AI interaction for regulatory and forensic purposes.</li>
    <li><strong>Resilience:</strong> Implement automatic fallbacks and load balancing across multiple AI providers to ensure 24/7 availability.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Course Roadmap</h2>
<p>This course will guide you through the design, implementation, and management of an enterprise-grade Private LLM Gateway:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Module 1: Design Principles:</strong> Foundations of secure gateway architecture.</li>
    <li><strong>Module 2: Proxy Architecture:</strong> Deep dive into the technical implementation of the proxy layer.</li>
    <li><strong>Module 3: Data Redaction:</strong> Techniques for real-time PII masking and data sanitization.</li>
    <li><strong>Module 4: Rate Limiting and Quotas:</strong> Ensuring fair and sustainable resource usage.</li>
    <li><strong>Module 5: Auditing and Logging:</strong> Building a comprehensive forensic trail for AI interactions.</li>
    <li><strong>Module 6: Key Management:</strong> Securely handling provider API keys within your VPC.</li>
    <li><strong>Module 7: Multi-model Routing:</strong> Optimizing for performance, cost, and reliability.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What You'll Learn</h2>
<p>By the end of this course, you will have the knowledge and practical skills to architect and deploy a secure LLM gateway that meets the most demanding enterprise security requirements. You will learn not just the "how" but the "why" behind every security control.</p>
