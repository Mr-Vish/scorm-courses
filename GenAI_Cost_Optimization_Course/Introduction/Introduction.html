<h1>Cost Optimization for GenAI on AWS</h1>

<div class="intro-section">
<h2>Course Overview</h2>
<p>Welcome to <strong>Cost Optimization for Generative AI on AWS</strong>. As organizations increasingly adopt Generative AI (GenAI) technologies to transform their business operations, understanding and managing the associated costs has become a critical competency. This comprehensive course equips you with the knowledge, strategies, and best practices needed to deploy GenAI solutions cost-effectively while maintaining optimal performance and quality.</p>

<p>Generative AI workloads differ significantly from traditional cloud computing in their cost structure. Unlike conventional applications where compute and storage dominate expenses, GenAI costs are primarily driven by model inference, token consumption, and data processing. Without proper cost management, GenAI implementations can quickly become financially unsustainable, potentially derailing promising AI initiatives.</p>

<h2>Purpose and Relevance</h2>
<p>This course addresses a critical gap in enterprise AI adoption: the ability to predict, monitor, and optimize GenAI costs. As AWS Bedrock, SageMaker, and other AI services become central to business operations, organizations need professionals who can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Architect cost-efficient GenAI solutions from the ground up</li>
<li>Identify and eliminate cost inefficiencies in existing deployments</li>
<li>Balance cost optimization with performance and quality requirements</li>
<li>Implement monitoring and governance frameworks for AI spending</li>
<li>Make informed decisions about model selection and deployment strategies</li>
</ul>

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
<p>By completing this course, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand the fundamental cost drivers of GenAI workloads on AWS</li>
<li>Analyze and compare pricing models across different AWS AI services</li>
<li>Implement token optimization strategies to reduce inference costs</li>
<li>Design and deploy caching mechanisms for GenAI applications</li>
<li>Select appropriate models based on cost-performance trade-offs</li>
<li>Apply batch processing and asynchronous patterns for cost savings</li>
<li>Implement monitoring and alerting for GenAI cost management</li>
<li>Develop comprehensive cost optimization strategies for enterprise GenAI deployments</li>
<li>Evaluate the financial impact of architectural decisions in GenAI systems</li>
</ul>

<h2>Expected Learner Outcomes</h2>
<p>Upon successful completion of this course, learners will:</p>
<ul>
