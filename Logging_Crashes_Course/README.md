## 🔒 Sequential Progression

The course enforces a strict learning path:

1. Users must complete pages in order
2. Assessments gate progression to next module
3. 70% score required to proceed past each assessment
4. Modal dialogs provide clear feedback
5. Final assessment has no "Next" button—only "Exit"

This ensures learners master each concept before advancing.
