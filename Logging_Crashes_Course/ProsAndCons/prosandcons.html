    <li><strong>Operational Costs:</strong> Personnel time for log management and analysis</li>
</ul>

<h3>Security and Privacy Concerns</h3>

<h4>1. Sensitive Data Exposure</h4>
<p>Logs can inadvertently capture sensitive information:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Personal Data:</strong> User names, email addresses, phone numbers</li>
    <li><strong>Credentials:</strong> Passwords, API keys, tokens accidentally logged</li>
    <li><strong>Financial Data:</strong> Credit card numbers, account balances</li>
    <li><strong>Health Information:</strong> Medical records or health data</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Risk:</strong> Logs become a target for attackers seeking sensitive data, and improper handling violates privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA).</p>

<h4>2. Log Injection Attacks</h4>
<p>Malicious users can inject crafted data into logs:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Log Forging:</strong> Injecting fake log entries to cover tracks</li>
    <li><strong>Log Poisoning:</strong> Injecting malicious content that exploits log analysis tools</li>
    <li><strong>Denial of Service:</strong> Triggering excessive logging to exhaust resources</li>
</ul>

<h4>3. Compliance Challenges</h4>
<p>Logging can create compliance obligations:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Data Retention:</strong> Logs containing personal data must comply with retention limits</li>
    <li><strong>Right to Erasure:</strong> GDPR requires ability to delete user data from logs</li>
    <li><strong>Data Localization:</strong> Some regulations require logs to remain in specific geographic regions</li>
    <li><strong>Access Controls:</strong> Logs must be protected with appropriate access restrictions</li>
</ul>

<h3>Operational Pitfalls</h3>

<h4>1. Log Overload</h4>
<p>Excessive logging can be counterproductive:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Signal-to-Noise Ratio:</strong> Important events buried in verbose logs</li>
    <li><strong>Analysis Paralysis:</strong> Too much data makes it difficult to find relevant information</li>
    <li><strong>Alert Fatigue:</strong> Excessive log-based alerts lead to ignored warnings</li>
</ul>

<h4>2. Inconsistent Practices</h4>
<p>Without standards, logging quality varies across teams and components:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Inconsistent Formats:</strong> Different log formats complicate analysis</li>
    <li><strong>Varying Verbosity:</strong> Some components over-log while others under-log</li>
    <li><strong>Missing Context:</strong> Logs lack necessary context for troubleshooting</li>
</ul>

<h4>3. False Sense of Security</h4>
<p>Comprehensive logging can create a false sense of observability:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Logging ≠ Monitoring:</strong> Logs alone don't provide real-time alerting</li>
    <li><strong>Reactive vs. Proactive:</strong> Logs are primarily reactive; metrics enable proactive monitoring</li>
    <li><strong>Blind Spots:</strong> Not everything can or should be logged</li>
</ul>

<h2>Balancing Trade-offs</h2>

<h3>Finding the Right Balance</h3>
<p>Effective logging requires balancing competing concerns:</p>

    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="rowheader">Centralization</td>
        <td>Difficult to correlate across services</td>
        <td>Unified view with local fallbacks</td>
        <td>Single point of failure, network overhead</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="rowheader">Structure</td>
        <td>Difficult to parse and analyze</td>
        <td>Structured data with human-readable messages</td>
        <td>Overly complex schemas, parsing overhead</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h3>Context-Specific Decisions</h3>
