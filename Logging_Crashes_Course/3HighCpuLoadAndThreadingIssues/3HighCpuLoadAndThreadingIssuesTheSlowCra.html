<h1>3. High CPU Load and Threading Issues (The &quot;Slow Crash&quot;)</h1>

<p>While not an instant crash, excessive logging can cause the application to become unresponsive, which is often considered a failure state.</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Synchronous Logging:</strong> If logging is purely <strong>synchronous</strong>, high-volume logging forces main application threads to block while waiting for disk I/O. This leads to extreme <strong>latency</strong> and application <strong>timeouts</strong> or <strong>deadlocks</strong> under load.</li>
    <li><strong>Excessive Logging in Loops:</strong> Logging inside tight, frequently executed loops can saturate the CPU with string formatting, context gathering, and I/O operations. This excessive CPU usage starves other critical application threads, leading to <strong>thread pool exhaustion</strong> and application unresponsiveness.</li>
</ul>
