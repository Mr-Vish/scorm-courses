<h1>Module 3: Best Practices for AI-Assisted Development</h1>

<div class="module-content">
    <h2>Maximizing Value While Minimizing Risk</h2>
    <p>To truly leverage Amazon Q Developer as a productivity multiplier, developers must adopt new habits and workflows. The following best practices will help you get the most out of the tool while maintaining high code quality.</p>

    <h3>1. Treat Amazon Q as a Junior Pair Programmer</h3>
    <p>Always assume the AI's suggestions are a starting point, not the final answer. Just as you would review code from a junior developer, critically examine every suggestion for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Correctness (does it handle edge cases?)</li>
        <li>Efficiency (is there a more performant way?)</li>
        <li>Security (does it introduce vulnerabilities?)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Master "Prompt Engineering" for Code</h3>
    <p>The quality of the output depends heavily on the quality of your input (context). To get better suggestions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Open Relevant Files:</strong> Amazon Q uses open tabs as context. Keep related files (interfaces, utility classes) open.</li>
        <li><strong>Write Detailed Comments:</strong> Instead of "<code>// sort list</code>", try "<code>// sort list of users by age descending using a custom comparator</code>".</li>
        <li><strong>Use Meaningful Variable Names:</strong> Clear naming conventions help the AI infer intent.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Iterate with the Chat Interface</h3>
    <p>Don't just rely on inline suggestions. If a suggestion is close but not quite right, highlight it and ask Amazon Q in the chat sidebar: "Can you rewrite this to handle null values?" or "Optimize this loop for large datasets." This interactive refinement is where the real power lies.</p>

    <h3>4. Maintain Rigorous Code Reviews</h3>
    <p>AI-generated code should go through the same, if not stricter, peer review process as human-written code. Reviewers should specifically look for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Subtle logic errors that look correct at a glance.</li>
        <li>Unnecessary complexity or hallucinated imports.</li>
        <li>Consistency with the rest of the codebase.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5. Leverage Security Scans Regularly</h3>
    <p>Don't wait for the CI/CD pipeline to catch vulnerabilities. Run Amazon Q's security scans frequently during development, especially after generating large blocks of code. Treat security warnings as blocking issues.</p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>AI-assisted development is a skill in itself. By combining the speed of Amazon Q with human judgment, creativity, and rigorous engineering discipline, you can achieve unprecedented levels of productivity and innovation.</p>
