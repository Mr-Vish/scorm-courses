<h1>Introduction to Multi-Step RAG with Spring AI</h1>

<div class="intro-section">
<p>Standard <strong>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)</strong> has revolutionized how we build AI applications by grounding LLM responses in verifiable, private data. However, the standard RAG pattern—a single retrieval step followed by a single generation step—often hits a ceiling when faced with complex, multi-faceted, or ambiguous queries.</p>

<p>This course dives deep into the next evolution of RAG: <strong>Multi-Step RAG</strong>. By leveraging the power of the Spring AI ecosystem, you will learn how to build sophisticated AI systems that can reason about a problem, decompose it into smaller tasks, iteratively search for information, and synthesize a comprehensive and accurate answer.</p>

<h2>Beyond the "One-Shot" Limitation</h2>
<p>In a traditional "One-Shot" RAG pipeline, the system's success depends entirely on the quality of the initial search. If the user's query is poorly phrased, or if the necessary information is spread across multiple documents that don't share the same keywords, the system will likely fail. Multi-step RAG overcomes this by:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Query Transformation:</strong> Rewriting or expanding the user's query to improve retrieval accuracy.</li>
    <li><strong>Iterative Retrieval:</strong> Searching, analyzing the results, and then searching again based on what was learned.</li>
    <li><strong>Re-ranking:</strong> Using a secondary, more expensive model to ensure that only the most relevant context is sent to the final generation step.</li>
    <li><strong>Multi-tool Use:</strong> Enabling the AI to choose between different data sources (vector stores, web search, databases) depending on the needs of the query.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why Spring AI?</h2>
<p>Spring AI provides a consistent, portable, and developer-friendly abstraction for building AI-powered applications in Java. It integrates seamlessly with the broader Spring ecosystem, allowing you to leverage familiar patterns (Dependency Injection, Beans, Configuration) to build complex AI pipelines. With its native support for multiple LLM providers, vector databases, and advanced features like Function Calling and Advisors, Spring AI is the ideal platform for building production-grade multi-step RAG systems.</p>

<h2>What You'll Learn</h2>
<p>This course is designed to take you from the fundamentals to advanced implementation:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Foundations:</strong> When and why multi-step RAG is required and how to configure your Spring Boot project.</li>
    <li><strong>Core Patterns:</strong> Implementing query expansion, re-ranking, and multi-stage retrieval.</li>
    <li><strong>Advanced Strategies:</strong> Deep dives into HyDE, Parent Document Retrieval, and Agentic RAG.</li>
    <li><strong>Evaluation and Optimization:</strong> How to measure the performance of your pipeline and optimize it for speed and cost.</li>
    <li><strong>Security and Best Practices:</strong> Protecting sensitive data and defending against prompt injection.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Course Structure</h2>
<p>The course is divided into 11 modules, each focusing on a specific aspect of the multi-step RAG journey. You will find detailed technical explanations, Java code examples, hands-on exercises, and module-specific assessments to reinforce your learning.</p>

<p>Get ready to elevate your AI development skills and build systems that can truly "reason" with their data!</p>
