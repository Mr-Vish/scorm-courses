<h1>4. The Re-ranking Step (Two-Stage Retrieval)</h1>

<p>The most common reason for RAG failure is that the &quot;top 3&quot; documents found by vector math aren&#x27;t actually the best ones. Re-ranking solves this by taking a larger set (e.g., top 20) and running a more expensive &quot;relevance score&quot; on them.</p>

<p>When implementing a custom re-ranker, you effectively compute a score $S = f(Query, Document)$ for every retrieved chunk, ensuring that the documents with the highest semantic signal are placed at the beginning of the prompt.</p>
