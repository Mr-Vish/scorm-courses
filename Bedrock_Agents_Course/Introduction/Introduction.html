<h1>Amazon Bedrock Agents - Building Autonomous AI Workflows</h1>

<div class="intro-section">
<h2>Course Overview</h2>
<p>Welcome to <strong>Amazon Bedrock Agents - Building Autonomous AI Workflows</strong>. This comprehensive course provides enterprise-level training on designing, implementing, and deploying intelligent agents using Amazon Bedrock. As organizations increasingly adopt generative AI, the ability to build autonomous agents that can reason, plan, and execute complex tasks has become a critical skill for cloud architects, AI engineers, and enterprise developers.</p>

<p>Amazon Bedrock Agents represents a paradigm shift in how we build AI-powered applications. Rather than creating rigid, rule-based systems or simple chatbots, Bedrock Agents enables the development of sophisticated autonomous systems that can understand natural language instructions, break down complex tasks into actionable steps, invoke APIs and tools, retrieve contextual information from knowledge bases, and deliver results—all while maintaining conversation context and adhering to safety guardrails.</p>

<h2>Purpose and Relevance</h2>
<p>In today's rapidly evolving AI landscape, organizations face mounting pressure to deliver intelligent automation that goes beyond simple query-response patterns. Traditional approaches to building AI applications often require extensive custom code, complex orchestration logic, and significant maintenance overhead. Amazon Bedrock Agents addresses these challenges by providing a managed, serverless framework that abstracts away infrastructure complexity while offering enterprise-grade security, scalability, and observability.</p>

<p>This course is relevant for professionals seeking to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Build production-ready AI agents for customer service, IT operations, data analysis, and business process automation</li>
    <li>Leverage foundation models (Claude, Titan, Llama) without managing infrastructure</li>
    <li>Integrate AI capabilities into existing enterprise systems through API-based action groups</li>
    <li>Implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) patterns using Bedrock Knowledge Bases</li>
    <li>Design multi-agent architectures for complex, domain-specific workflows</li>
    <li>Ensure responsible AI deployment through guardrails and content filtering</li>
</ul>

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
<p>By the end of this course, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Understand Bedrock Agent Architecture:</strong> Explain the core components, orchestration flow, and integration patterns of Amazon Bedrock Agents</li>
    <li><strong>Design and Configure Agents:</strong> Create agents with appropriate foundation models, instructions, and session management strategies</li>
    <li><strong>Implement Action Groups:</strong> Define OpenAPI schemas, integrate Lambda functions, and enable agents to perform real-world actions</li>
    <li><strong>Integrate Knowledge Bases:</strong> Connect agents to vector databases for contextual information retrieval and grounding</li>
    <li><strong>Apply Advanced Capabilities:</strong> Implement multi-agent collaboration, return of control patterns, and prompt engineering techniques</li>
    <li><strong>Monitor and Optimize:</strong> Use trace logging, CloudWatch metrics, and debugging strategies to improve agent performance</li>
    <li><strong>Ensure Security and Compliance:</strong> Apply IAM policies, guardrails, and data protection best practices</li>
    <li><strong>Evaluate Trade-offs:</strong> Assess when to use Bedrock Agents versus alternative approaches based on use case requirements</li>
</ul>

<h2>Course Structure</h2>
<p>This course contains <strong>4 comprehensive modules</strong> with <strong>multiple content pages per module</strong>, followed by module-specific assessments and a final comprehensive assessment. The structure is designed to build knowledge progressively:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Module 1: Bedrock Foundations and Core Concepts</strong> - Understanding the Bedrock ecosystem, foundation models, and agent fundamentals</li>
    <li><strong>Module 2: Agent Architecture and Configuration</strong> - Deep dive into agent components, orchestration flow, and setup procedures</li>
    <li><strong>Module 3: Action Groups and Knowledge Bases</strong> - Implementing API integrations and RAG-enabled knowledge retrieval</li>
    <li><strong>Module 4: Advanced Capabilities and Production Patterns</strong> - Multi-agent collaboration, monitoring, optimization, and enterprise deployment</li>
</ul>

<p>Each module concludes with an assessment requiring <strong>70% or higher</strong> to proceed. The course culminates in a comprehensive final assessment covering all modules.</p>

<h2>How to Navigate</h2>
<p>Use the <strong>Next</strong> and <strong>Previous</strong> buttons at the bottom right to move through the course. Your progress is saved automatically, so you can resume where you left off if you exit and return later. You must pass each module assessment before proceeding to the next module.</p>

<h2>Assessment Policy</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Each module has a dedicated assessment testing concepts from that module</li>
    <li>You must score <strong>70% or higher</strong> on each assessment to unlock the next module</li>
    <li>Assessments can be retaken if you do not pass on the first attempt</li>
    <li>The final assessment covers all modules and must be passed to complete the course</li>
</ul>

<h2>Time Commitment</h2>
<p>This course is designed to be completed in approximately <strong>4-6 hours</strong>, depending on your prior experience with AWS and generative AI. We recommend taking breaks between modules to reinforce learning and experiment with the concepts in your own AWS environment.</p>

<h2>Hands-On Practice</h2>
<p>While this course focuses on theoretical foundations and conceptual understanding, we strongly encourage learners to practice in their own AWS accounts. Many concepts can be explored using the AWS Free Tier, though some Bedrock model invocations may incur minimal costs.</p>
