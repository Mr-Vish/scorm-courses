<h1>Formality and Sentiment Adjustment</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Formality and sentiment are two critical dimensions that AI writing assistants must manage independently yet harmoniously. This section explores how to adjust these dimensions to match communication requirements while maintaining message integrity.</p>

<h2>Understanding Formality</h2>

<h3>The Formality Spectrum</h3>
<p>Formality exists on a continuum from highly casual to highly formal:</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Level</th>
        <th>Characteristics</th>
        <th>Appropriate Contexts</th>
        <th>Example</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="rowheader">Highly Formal</td>
        <td>Complex syntax, passive voice, no contractions, Latinate vocabulary</td>
        <td>Legal documents, academic papers, official statements</td>
        <td>"It is hereby requested that all participants submit documentation"</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="rowheader">Formal</td>
        <td>Professional vocabulary, complete sentences, standard grammar</td>
        <td>Business correspondence, reports, professional presentations</td>
        <td>"Please submit your documentation by the deadline"</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="rowheader">Neutral</td>
        <td>Clear, straightforward language, balanced structure</td>
        <td>General business communication, instructions, informational content</td>
        <td>"Send your documents by Friday"</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="rowheader">Casual</td>
        <td>Conversational tone, contractions, simpler vocabulary</td>
        <td>Internal team communication, friendly customer interactions</td>
        <td>"Can you send those docs by Friday?"</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="rowheader">Highly Casual</td>
        <td>Colloquialisms, fragments, slang, informal expressions</td>
        <td>Close colleague communication, social media, informal contexts</td>
        <td>"Shoot me those docs by Fri, thanks!"</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h3>Formality Markers</h3>

<h4>Lexical Markers</h4>
<p>Word choice signals formality level:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Formal:</strong> commence, utilize, purchase, residence, terminate</li>
    <li><strong>Neutral:</strong> begin, use, buy, home, end</li>
    <li><strong>Casual:</strong> start, grab, get, place, stop</li>
</ul>

<h4>Grammatical Markers</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Contractions:</strong> Absence (formal) vs. presence (casual)</li>
    <li><strong>Sentence Length:</strong> Longer, complex (formal) vs. shorter, simple (casual)</li>
    <li><strong>Voice:</strong> Passive (formal) vs. active (casual)</li>
    <li><strong>Personal Pronouns:</strong> Avoided (formal) vs. frequent (casual)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Understanding Sentiment</h2>

<h3>Sentiment Dimensions</h3>
<p>Sentiment refers to the emotional polarity and intensity of text:</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Sentiment</th>
        <th>Characteristics</th>
        <th>Indicators</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="rowheader">Positive</td>
        <td>Optimistic, favorable, approving</td>
        <td>Excellent, wonderful, pleased, excited, successful</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="rowheader">Neutral</td>
        <td>Objective, factual, balanced</td>
        <td>Adequate, standard, acceptable, typical</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="rowheader">Negative</td>
        <td>Critical, unfavorable, disappointed</td>
        <td>Poor, failed, disappointed, problematic, inadequate</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="rowheader">Mixed</td>
        <td>Contains both positive and negative elements</td>
        <td>"Good effort, but needs improvement"</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h3>Sentiment Intensity</h3>
<p>Sentiment varies in strength:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Strong Positive:</strong> "This is absolutely fantastic and exceeded all expectations!"</li>
    <li><strong>Moderate Positive:</strong> "This is good and meets our needs well."</li>
    <li><strong>Mild Positive:</strong> "This is acceptable and works adequately."</li>
    <li><strong>Neutral:</strong> "This is the standard approach."</li>
    <li><strong>Mild Negative:</strong> "This has some areas that could be improved."</li>
    <li><strong>Moderate Negative:</strong> "This has significant problems that need addressing."</li>
    <li><strong>Strong Negative:</strong> "This is completely unacceptable and fails to meet basic requirements."</li>
</ul>

<h2>Formality Adjustment Techniques</h2>

<h3>Increasing Formality</h3>

<h4>Technique 1: Vocabulary Elevation</h4>
<p>Replace casual words with formal equivalents:</p>
<ul>
    <li>get → obtain, acquire, receive</li>
    <li>show → demonstrate, illustrate, exhibit</li>
    <li>help → assist, facilitate, support</li>
    <li>think → believe, consider, conclude</li>
</ul>

<h4>Technique 2: Eliminate Contractions</h4>
<ul>
    <li>can't → cannot</li>
    <li>we'll → we will</li>
    <li>it's → it is</li>
    <li>you're → you are</li>
</ul>

<h4>Technique 3: Increase Sentence Complexity</h4>
<p><strong>Casual:</strong> "We tested the system. It works well."</p>
<p><strong>Formal:</strong> "Following comprehensive testing, the system has demonstrated satisfactory performance."</p>

<h4>Technique 4: Use Passive Voice Strategically</h4>
<p><strong>Active (Casual):</strong> "The team completed the analysis."</p>
<p><strong>Passive (Formal):</strong> "The analysis was completed by the team."</p>

<h3>Decreasing Formality</h3>

<h4>Technique 1: Simplify Vocabulary</h4>
<p>Replace formal words with everyday language:</p>
<ul>
    <li>utilize → use</li>
    <li>commence → start</li>
    <li>terminate → end</li>
    <li>facilitate → help</li>
</ul>

<h4>Technique 2: Add Contractions</h4>
<p>Make text more conversational with appropriate contractions.</p>

<h4>Technique 3: Shorten Sentences</h4>
<p><strong>Formal:</strong> "It is recommended that participants review the documentation prior to attendance."</p>
<p><strong>Casual:</strong> "Please review the docs before you attend."</p>

<h4>Technique 4: Use Active Voice</h4>
<p><strong>Passive (Formal):</strong> "The report will be reviewed by management."</p>
<p><strong>Active (Casual):</strong> "Management will review the report."</p>

<h2>Sentiment Adjustment Techniques</h2>

<h3>Softening Negative Sentiment</h3>

<h4>Technique 1: Hedging Language</h4>
<p>Add qualifiers to reduce harshness:</p>
<ul>
    <li>"This is wrong" → "This may not be entirely accurate"</li>
    <li>"You failed" → "This didn't meet the requirements"</li>
    <li>"This is terrible" → "This has some significant challenges"</li>
</ul>

<h4>Technique 2: Positive Framing</h4>
<p>Focus on solutions rather than problems:</p>
<ul>
    <li>"You didn't complete the task" → "Let's work on completing the task"</li>
    <li>"This is broken" → "This needs some adjustments to work properly"</li>
</ul>

<h4>Technique 3: Sandwich Technique</h4>
<p>Surround negative feedback with positive elements:</p>
<p>"Your presentation had good content [positive], but the delivery could be more engaging [negative]. Your research was thorough [positive]."</p>

<h3>Enhancing Positive Sentiment</h3>

<h4>Technique 1: Amplification</h4>
<p>Strengthen positive language:</p>
<ul>
    <li>"Good" → "Excellent"</li>
    <li>"Works well" → "Performs exceptionally"</li>
    <li>"Helpful" → "Invaluable"</li>
</ul>

<h4>Technique 2: Specificity</h4>
<p>Make praise more concrete:</p>
<p>"Good job" → "Your analysis of the market trends was insightful and well-researched"</p>

<h3>Neutralizing Sentiment</h3>

<h4>Technique 1: Remove Emotional Language</h4>
<p><strong>Emotional:</strong> "We're thrilled to announce this amazing new feature!"</p>
<p><strong>Neutral:</strong> "We are announcing the availability of this new feature."</p>

<h4>Technique 2: Use Objective Descriptors</h4>
<p>Replace subjective assessments with factual descriptions:</p>
<ul>
    <li>"Terrible performance" → "Performance below benchmark"</li>
    <li>"Fantastic results" → "Results exceeded targets by 25%"</li>
</ul>

    </tr>
</table>

<h3>Context-Appropriate Combinations</h3>
