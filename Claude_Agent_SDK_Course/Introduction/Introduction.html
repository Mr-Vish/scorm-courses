<h1>Building Custom Agents with Claude Agent SDK</h1>

<div class="intro-section">

<h2>Course Overview</h2>
<p>Welcome to <strong>Building Custom Agents with Claude Agent SDK</strong>. This comprehensive course teaches you how to build autonomous AI agents using Anthropic's Claude Agent SDK. You'll learn to create agents that can reason, use tools, maintain state, and complete complex multi-step tasks autonomously.</p>

<p>The Claude Agent SDK represents a paradigm shift from simple chatbots to intelligent agents capable of planning, executing actions, and adapting their behavior. This course provides the theoretical foundations and practical patterns needed to build production-ready agent systems.</p>

<h2>Purpose and Relevance</h2>
<p>AI agents are transforming how we interact with software systems. Unlike traditional chatbots that respond to single queries, agents can:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Autonomous Execution:</strong> Complete multi-step tasks without constant human guidance</li>
    <li><strong>Tool Orchestration:</strong> Intelligently select and use multiple tools to achieve goals</li>
    <li><strong>Adaptive Planning:</strong> Adjust strategies based on intermediate results and changing conditions</li>
    <li><strong>State Management:</strong> Maintain context and memory across extended interactions</li>
    <li><strong>Complex Problem Solving:</strong> Break down complex problems into manageable subtasks</li>
</ul>

<p>Understanding agent development is crucial for building next-generation AI applications in customer service, data analysis, workflow automation, research assistance, and software development.</p>

<h2>Course Structure</h2>
<p>This course is organized into <strong>3 comprehensive modules</strong>, each followed by an assessment:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Module 1: Agent Fundamentals</strong> – Core concepts, agent loop, tool definitions, and basic agent patterns</li>
    <li><strong>Module 2: Advanced Agent Patterns</strong> – Multi-tool orchestration, state management, memory systems, and complex workflows</li>
    <li><strong>Module 3: Production Agent Systems</strong> – Guardrails, error handling, testing, deployment, and operational considerations</li>
    <li><strong>Final Assessment:</strong> Comprehensive evaluation covering all course modules</li>
</ul>

<p>Each module contains multiple lessons with detailed explanations, conceptual frameworks, design patterns, and real-world examples. Assessments require a minimum score of 70% to progress.</p>

<h2>How to Navigate This Course</h2>
<p>Use the <strong>Next</strong> and <strong>Previous</strong> buttons at the bottom right to move through the course content. Your progress is automatically saved, allowing you to exit and resume at any time. Complete each module's assessment before proceeding to the next module.</p>

<h2>Learning Approach</h2>
<p>This course emphasizes <strong>conceptual understanding and design patterns</strong> over code implementation details. While code examples are provided for illustration, the focus is on:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Understanding agent architecture and execution flow</li>
