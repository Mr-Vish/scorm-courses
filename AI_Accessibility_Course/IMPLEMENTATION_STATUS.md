## 📝 NOTES

- The existing old folders (Introduction/, AIAccessibility/, DocumentAccessibility/, Implementation/, Assessment1/, Assessment2/) can be deleted after migration is complete
- The shared/ folder contains reusable assets (style.css, scormfunctions.js, assessmenttemplate.html) - these are still valid
- The launchpage.html has been updated to reference the new structure
- All assessments use the shared/assessmenttemplate.html for consistent rendering
- Mobile responsiveness is built into launchpage.html navigation
- Assessment gating is implemented (must pass 70% to proceed)
