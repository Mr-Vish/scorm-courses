<h1>Module 1: Foundations of AI and Accessibility</h1>

<h2>Course Overview</h2>
<p>Welcome to <strong>GenAI for Accessibility: Transforming Digital Inclusion</strong>. This comprehensive enterprise-level course explores how Generative AI technologies are revolutionizing digital accessibility, making content accessible to over 1.3 billion people worldwide living with disabilities. You will learn evidence-based techniques for implementing AI-powered accessibility solutions including automated alt text generation, video transcription, document remediation, and compliance testing.</p>

<p>Digital accessibility is simultaneously a legal requirement under laws such as the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Section 508, and the European Accessibility Act, and a moral imperative rooted in principles of universal design and digital equity. This course equips you with the knowledge and practical skills to leverage AI tools effectively while maintaining the human oversight necessary for quality assurance and regulatory compliance.</p>

<h2>Purpose and Relevance</h2>
<p>The convergence of artificial intelligence and accessibility represents one of the most significant technological advances in digital inclusion. Organizations face mounting pressure to ensure their digital properties are accessible, driven by:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Legal mandates:</strong> Increasing litigation and regulatory enforcement worldwide</li>
<li><strong>Market opportunity:</strong> The disability market represents $13 trillion in annual disposable income globally</li>
<li><strong>Brand reputation:</strong> Accessibility failures result in negative publicity and customer loss</li>
<li><strong>Technical debt:</strong> Legacy content often lacks basic accessibility features</li>
<li><strong>Scale challenges:</strong> Manual accessibility remediation cannot keep pace with content creation</li>
</ul>

<p>AI technologies offer unprecedented capabilities to address these challenges at scale, reducing costs by 70-90% while accelerating remediation timelines from years to months. However, successful implementation requires understanding both the capabilities and limitations of AI, as well as the regulatory and ethical frameworks governing accessibility.</p>
