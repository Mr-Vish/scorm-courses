<h1>Understanding Accessibility: Principles and Disability Types</h1>

<h2>Module Objectives</h2>
<p>In this page, you will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand the scope and impact of disability worldwide</li>
<li>Identify different types of disabilities and their digital barriers</li>
<li>Learn the social model of disability versus the medical model</li>
<li>Explore how assistive technologies enable digital access</li>
<li>Recognize the business and ethical case for accessibility</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Global Impact of Disability</h2>
<p>According to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately <strong>16% of the global population</strong>—over 1.3 billion people—experience significant disability. This represents one in six people worldwide. Disability prevalence is increasing due to aging populations, rising chronic health conditions, and improved survival rates from medical interventions.</p>

<p>Key statistics that underscore the importance of digital accessibility:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>253 million people</strong> live with vision impairment, including 36 million who are blind</li>
<li><strong>466 million people</strong> worldwide have disabling hearing loss</li>
<li><strong>75 million people</strong> need a wheelchair on a daily basis</li>
<li><strong>200 million people</strong> experience significant difficulties in functioning due to cognitive impairments</li>
<li><strong>1 in 4 adults</strong> in the United States has some type of disability</li>
</ul>

<p>These numbers represent not just individuals, but families, communities, and a substantial economic market. The disability market controls over <strong>$13 trillion in annual disposable income</strong> globally, making accessibility both a social responsibility and a business opportunity.</p>

</ul>

<h2>Models of Disability</h2>

<h3>The Medical Model</h3>
<p>The medical model views disability as a problem residing within the individual that needs to be "fixed" or "cured." This perspective focuses on diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation.</p>

<p><strong>Limitations:</strong> This model places the burden of adaptation on individuals with disabilities rather than on society and technology.</p>

<h3>The Social Model</h3>
<p>The social model recognizes that disability results from the interaction between individuals and barriers in their environment. People are disabled by society's failure to accommodate diverse needs, not by their impairments.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> A person using a wheelchair is not disabled by their mobility impairment but by buildings without ramps, elevators, or accessible entrances. Similarly, a blind person is not disabled by their vision impairment but by websites that lack proper alt text and screen reader compatibility.</p>

<p><strong>Implication for digital accessibility:</strong> Our responsibility is to remove barriers in digital environments, not to expect users to overcome them. This is the foundation of universal design and accessible technology.</p>

<h2>Assistive Technology Ecosystem</h2>

<h3>Screen Readers</h3>
<p>Screen readers are software applications that convert digital text into synthesized speech or braille output. They are the primary tool used by people who are blind or have severe vision impairments.</p>

<p><strong>Popular screen readers:</strong></p>
<table>
<tr><th>Screen Reader</th><th>Platform</th><th>Cost</th><th>Market Share</th></tr>
<tr><td>JAWS</td><td>Windows</td><td>Commercial ($90-1,600)</td><td>~40%</td></tr>
<tr><td>NVDA</td><td>Windows</td><td>Free (open source)</td><td>~30%</td></tr>
<tr><td>VoiceOver</td><td>macOS, iOS</td><td>Free (built-in)</td><td>~15%</td></tr>
<tr><td>TalkBack</td><td>Android</td><td>Free (built-in)</td><td>~10%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Narrator</td><td>Windows</td><td>Free (built-in)</td><td>~5%</td></tr>
</table>

<p><strong>How screen readers work:</strong> Screen readers parse the Document Object Model (DOM) of web pages, extracting semantic information from HTML elements, ARIA attributes, and text content. They announce this information to users through speech synthesis or braille displays, enabling non-visual navigation and interaction.</p>

<h3>Browser Extensions and Tools</h3>
<p>Many users rely on browser extensions to customize their web experience:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Read&Write:</strong> Literacy support with text-to-speech and word prediction</li>
<li><strong>Helperbird:</strong> Dyslexia support with fonts, colors, and reading tools</li>
<li><strong>Dark Reader:</strong> Automatic dark mode for reducing eye strain</li>
<li><strong>NoSquint:</strong> Per-site zoom and color adjustments</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Business Case for Accessibility</h2>

<h3>Market Reach</h3>
<p>Accessible digital properties reach a larger audience. With 16% of the global population having disabilities, inaccessible websites and applications exclude a significant market segment. Additionally, accessibility features benefit many users without disabilities, including older adults, people with temporary impairments, and those in situational limitations (e.g., bright sunlight, noisy environments).</p>

<h3>Legal Compliance</h3>
<p>Accessibility is legally mandated in many jurisdictions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>United States:</strong> Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act</li>
<li><strong>European Union:</strong> European Accessibility Act, EN 301 549 standard</li>
<li><strong>United Kingdom:</strong> Equality Act 2010, Public Sector Bodies Accessibility Regulations</li>
<li><strong>Canada:</strong> Accessible Canada Act, AODA (Ontario)</li>
<li><strong>Australia:</strong> Disability Discrimination Act 1992</li>
</ul>

<p>Non-compliance can result in lawsuits, fines, and mandatory remediation. In the United States, web accessibility lawsuits have increased by over 300% in recent years, with thousands of cases filed annually.</p>

<h3>Brand Reputation</h3>
<p>Organizations that prioritize accessibility demonstrate social responsibility and inclusive values. Conversely, accessibility failures generate negative publicity, social media backlash, and customer attrition. High-profile accessibility lawsuits against major brands have resulted in significant reputational damage.</p>

<h3>SEO and Technical Benefits</h3>
<p>Many accessibility best practices align with search engine optimization (SEO):</p>
<ul>
<li>Semantic HTML improves content structure for search engines</li>
<li>Alt text provides context for images</li>
<li>Transcripts make video content searchable</li>
<li>Clear headings improve content hierarchy</li>
<li>Keyboard navigation indicates well-structured code</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Ethical Imperative</h2>
<p>Beyond legal and business considerations, accessibility is fundamentally about human rights and digital equity. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) recognizes access to information and communications technologies as a human right.</p>

<p>Digital accessibility ensures that people with disabilities can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Access education and employment opportunities</li>
<li>Participate in civic and political processes</li>
<li>Engage in social and cultural activities</li>
<li>Access healthcare information and services</li>
<li>Conduct financial transactions and manage personal affairs</li>
<li>Exercise independence and autonomy</li>
</ul>

<p>As digital technology becomes increasingly central to modern life, ensuring accessibility is essential for preventing the exclusion and marginalization of people with disabilities.</p>
