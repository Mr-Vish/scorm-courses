<h1>Introduction to Large Language Models - How They Work</h1>

<div class="intro-section">
<p>Welcome to <strong>Introduction to Large Language Models - How They Work</strong>. Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming how we interact with technology, powering everything from chatbots and code assistants to content generation and data analysis. This course provides comprehensive coverage of fundamental concepts, practical applications, and best practices to help you understand and effectively work with LLMs.</p>

<h2>What You'll Learn</h2>
<p>By the end of this course, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand the core architecture and mechanics of Large Language Models</li>
<li>Explain how LLMs are trained, fine-tuned, and aligned with human values</li>
<li>Apply effective prompt engineering techniques to optimize LLM outputs</li>
<li>Identify appropriate use cases and applications for LLMs in real-world scenarios</li>
<li>Evaluate the advantages and limitations of LLM technology</li>
<li>Make informed decisions about when and how to use LLMs in your projects</li>
</ul>

<h2>Course Modules</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Module 1: LLM Fundamentals</strong> - Core concepts, architecture, and how LLMs generate text</li>
<li><strong>Module 2: LLM Applications & Use Cases</strong> - Real-world applications and practical implementation patterns</li>
<li><strong>Module 3: Prompt Engineering</strong> - Techniques for crafting effective prompts and optimizing outputs</li>
<li><strong>Module 4: Pros and Cons</strong> - Advantages, limitations, and ethical considerations</li>
</ul>

<li>Students and professionals seeking to understand modern AI capabilities</li>
</ul>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>To get the most out of this course, you should have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic understanding of software development concepts</li>
<li>Familiarity with APIs and web services (helpful but not required)</li>
<li>General awareness of machine learning concepts (helpful but not required)</li>
<li>No prior experience with LLMs or deep learning is necessary</li>
</ul>

<h2>Course Structure</h2>
<p>This course contains <strong>4 modules</strong> with <strong>8 content pages</strong>, followed by assessments to test your understanding. Each module includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Detailed explanations with real-world examples</li>
<li>Practical code snippets and implementation patterns</li>
<li>Module assessments to reinforce learning</li>
</ul>
<p>You need to score 70% or higher on each assessment to proceed to the next module.</p>

<h2>How to Navigate</h2>
<p>Use the <strong>Next</strong> and <strong>Previous</strong> buttons at the bottom right to move through the course. Your progress is saved automatically, so you can resume where you left off if you exit and return later.</p>
