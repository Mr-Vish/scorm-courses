<h1>HIPAA, FDA, and SOX Requirements for AI</h1>


<h2>AI in Regulated Industries</h2>
<p>Healthcare, finance, and legal sectors face strict regulatory requirements that constrain how AI can be used. Understanding these requirements is essential for any organization deploying GenAI in these domains.</p>

<h2>Healthcare: HIPAA and FDA</h2>
<table>
    <tr><th>Regulation</th><th>Requirement</th><th>Impact on GenAI</th></tr>
    <tr><td>HIPAA Privacy Rule</td><td>Protect patient health information (PHI)</td><td>PHI must never reach third-party LLM APIs without a BAA</td></tr>
    <tr><td>HIPAA Security Rule</td><td>Technical safeguards for electronic PHI</td><td>Encryption at rest and in transit, access controls, audit logs</td></tr>
    <tr><td>FDA SaMD</td><td>Software as a Medical Device regulation</td><td>AI that diagnoses or recommends treatment may need FDA clearance</td></tr>
    <tr><td>FDA 21 CFR Part 11</td><td>Electronic records and signatures</td><td>AI-assisted clinical documentation needs audit trails</td></tr>
</table>

<h2>Healthcare AI Architecture</h2>
<div class="code-block">
<pre><code># HIPAA-compliant GenAI architecture
# Key principle: PHI never leaves your controlled environment

# Option 1: On-premise model (highest compliance)
# - Run Llama 3 or Phi-3 on your own hardware
# - PHI stays within your security boundary
# - Full control over data retention

# Option 2: Cloud with BAA
# - Use Azure OpenAI (Microsoft signs BAA)
# - Use AWS Bedrock (Amazon signs BAA)
# - Deploy within your cloud VPC
# - Enable customer-managed encryption keys

# Option 3: De-identification pipeline
# 1. Strip all 18 HIPAA identifiers before LLM call
# 2. Process de-identified text with any LLM
# 3. Re-associate with patient record after response
# WARNING: De-identification must be validated - regex is not sufficient</code></pre>
</div>

<h2>Finance: SOX, SEC, and Banking Regulations</h2>
<table>
    <tr><th>Regulation</th><th>Requirement</th><th>Impact on GenAI</th></tr>
    <tr><td>SOX (Sarbanes-Oxley)</td><td>Internal controls over financial reporting</td><td>AI-generated financial reports need human sign-off and audit trails</td></tr>
    <tr><td>SEC Fair Disclosure</td><td>Consistent public disclosures</td><td>AI must not generate materially different disclosures for different audiences</td></tr>
    <tr><td>SR 11-7 (OCC/Fed)</td><td>Model risk management for banks</td><td>AI models used in lending decisions need full validation and documentation</td></tr>
    <tr><td>GDPR/CCPA</td><td>Right to explanation</td><td>Automated decisions must be explainable to affected individuals</td></tr>
</table>

<h2>Legal Industry Considerations</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Attorney-client privilege:</strong> Sending client information to third-party AI services may waive privilege</li>
    <li><strong>Duty of competence:</strong> Lawyers must understand AI limitations (ABA Model Rule 1.1)</li>
    <li><strong>Court requirements:</strong> Several courts now require disclosure of AI use in legal filings</li>
    <li><strong>Hallucination risk:</strong> AI-generated legal citations must be verified (see Mata v. Avianca case)</li>
</ul>
