<h1>Google Cloud Vector Search for GenAI Applications</h1>

<h2>Course Overview</h2>
<p>Welcome to <strong>Google Cloud Vector Search for GenAI Applications</strong>. This comprehensive course equips you with the knowledge and practical skills to implement high-performance vector search solutions using Google Cloud's Vertex AI platform. As generative AI applications become increasingly sophisticated, the ability to efficiently search and retrieve semantically similar information from large-scale datasets has become a critical capability.</p>

<h2>What You'll Learn</h2>
<p>This course is structured into three core modules, each building upon the previous to provide a complete understanding of vector search technology:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Module 1: Vector Search Foundations</strong> - Understanding embeddings, similarity metrics, indexing algorithms, and the fundamental concepts that power semantic search</li>
<li><strong>Module 2: Vector Search Implementation</strong> - Hands-on implementation of Vertex AI Vector Search, including index creation, deployment, querying, and performance optimization</li>
<li><strong>Module 3: RAG Applications</strong> - Building production-ready Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems that combine vector search with large language models</li>
</ul>

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
<p>By the end of this course, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand the mathematical foundations of vector embeddings and similarity search</li>
<li>Design and implement scalable vector search indexes using Vertex AI</li>
<li>Optimize search performance for latency, throughput, and accuracy</li>
<li>Build RAG pipelines that enhance LLM responses with relevant context</li>
<li>Apply best practices for production deployment and cost optimization</li>
<li>Evaluate trade-offs between different indexing strategies and configurations</li>
</ul>

<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>This course is designed for:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ML Engineers</strong> building generative AI applications</li>
<li><strong>Data Scientists</strong> working with embeddings and semantic search</li>
<li><strong>Cloud Architects</strong> designing scalable AI infrastructure</li>
<li><strong>Software Developers</strong> integrating vector search into applications</li>
</ul>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>To get the most from this course, you should have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic understanding of machine learning concepts</li>
<li>Familiarity with Python programming</li>
<li>Experience with Google Cloud Platform (helpful but not required)</li>
<li>Understanding of REST APIs and cloud services</li>
</ul>

<h2>Course Structure</h2>
<p>This course contains <strong>3 modules</strong> with <strong>11 content pages</strong>, followed by module assessments and a comprehensive final assessment. Each module includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Detailed conceptual explanations with real-world examples</li>
<li>Practical code demonstrations and implementation patterns</li>
<li>Performance considerations and optimization strategies</li>
<li>Module assessment to validate your understanding</li>
</ul>

<p>You need to score <strong>70% or higher</strong> on each assessment to proceed to the next module.</p>

<h2>How to Navigate</h2>
<p>Use the <strong>Next</strong> and <strong>Previous</strong> buttons at the bottom right to move through the course. Your progress is saved automatically, so you can resume where you left off if you exit and return later.</p>

<h2>Why Vector Search Matters</h2>
<p>Traditional keyword-based search struggles with semantic understanding. Vector search enables applications to find information based on <em>meaning</em> rather than exact word matches. This capability is fundamental to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems</li>
<li>Semantic document search and recommendation engines</li>
<li>Question-answering systems with contextual understanding</li>
<li>Multi-modal search across text, images, and other data types</li>
<li>Personalization and content discovery at scale</li>
</ul>

<p>Let's begin your journey into the world of vector search and generative AI!</p>
