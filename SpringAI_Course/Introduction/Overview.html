<h1>Spring AI: Your First Step into Generative AI with Java</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Often Java-based enterprise systems find it difficult to work with Python libraries and related tool chains. <strong>Spring AI</strong> is an open-source framework designed to simplify the development of applications that incorporate Artificial Intelligence capabilities, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs), using the familiar patterns of the Spring ecosystem.</p>

<p>If you are a Java developer looking to integrate powerful features like ChatGPT or Google Gemini into your enterprise applications without wrestling with provider-specific SDKs, Spring AI is the perfect tool.</p>

<h2>What is Spring AI?</h2>
<p>At its core, Spring AI acts as a <strong>common abstraction layer for AI models</strong>.</p>

<p>Think of it like Spring Data JPA for databases: just as Spring Data abstracts away SQL and database specifics, Spring AI abstracts away the differences between various AI providers (OpenAI, Google, Azure, Anthropic, etc.).</p>

<h2>Key Benefits</h2>
<p>This approach offers two huge benefits:</p>

<h3>Portability</h3>
<p>You can switch between different AI models and providers with minimal code changes, allowing you to choose the most cost-effective or highest-performing model for your use case.</p>

<h3>Familiarity</h3>
<p>It uses standard Spring concepts like dependency injection, auto-configuration, and fluent APIs (like WebClient or JdbcClient), making the learning curve shallow for millions of existing Spring developers.</p>

<h2>Course Objectives</h2>
<p>By the end of this course, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Understand what Spring AI is and why it's valuable for Java developers</li>
    <li>Compare Spring AI with Python-based alternatives like LangChain</li>
    <li>Set up a Spring Boot project with Spring AI dependencies</li>
    <li>Build a simple chat service using ChatClient</li>
    <li>Integrate with AI providers like OpenAI</li>
    <li>Explore advanced topics like RAG and Structured Output</li>
</ul>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>To get the most out of this course, you should have:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Java Programming:</strong> Solid understanding of Java 8+ features</li>
    <li><strong>Spring Boot:</strong> Basic familiarity with Spring Boot applications</li>
    <li><strong>Maven/Gradle:</strong> Understanding of dependency management</li>
    <li><strong>REST APIs:</strong> Knowledge of building RESTful web services</li>
</ul>
