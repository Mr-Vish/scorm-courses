<h1>Introduction to Multi-Model AI with OpenRouter and LiteLLM</h1>

<div class="intro-section">
<p>In the rapidly evolving landscape of Large Language Models (LLMs), developers are no longer tied to a single provider. The ability to seamlessly switch between models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, and others is a critical competitive advantage. This course explores two powerful tools that make multi-model orchestration possible: <strong>OpenRouter</strong> and <strong>LiteLLM</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>OpenRouter</strong> is a unified API for nearly every LLM in existence. It provides a single point of entry to dozens of models, handling the complexities of authentication, pricing, and availability behind the scenes. <strong>LiteLLM</strong> is a lightweight Python library and proxy server that provides an OpenAI-compatible interface for over 100 different LLMs.</p>

<h2>Why a Unified Interface Matters</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>No Vendor Lock-in:</strong> Easily switch providers if one becomes too expensive or if a better model is released.</li>
    <li><strong>Increased Reliability:</strong> Implement automatic fallbacks so that if one provider is down, your application stays up.</li>
    <li><strong>Simplified Development:</strong> Use a single API format (the OpenAI standard) for every model you use.</li>
    <li><strong>Cost Optimization:</strong> Route requests to the most cost-effective model based on the complexity of the task.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Course Roadmap</h2>
<p>This course will take you from basic usage to advanced production patterns:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Module 1: Fundamentals:</strong> Basic usage of OpenRouter and LiteLLM for unified API access.</li>
    <li><strong>Module 2: LiteLLM Proxy:</strong> Setting up a centralized proxy server for your organization's AI needs.</li>
    <li><strong>Module 3: Fallback and Redundancy:</strong> Designing resilient AI applications that never fail.</li>
    <li><strong>Module 4: Cost Tracking and Optimization:</strong> Monitoring and reducing your AI spend across multiple providers.</li>
    <li><strong>Module 5: Multi-model Orchestration:</strong> Advanced patterns for routing and chaining different models.</li>
    <li><strong>Module 6: Security and Governance:</strong> Managing API keys, rate limits, and audit logs centrally.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What You'll Achieve</h2>
<p>By the end of this course, you will be able to build enterprise-grade AI applications that are resilient, cost-effective, and capable of leveraging the best models from across the entire AI ecosystem.</p>
