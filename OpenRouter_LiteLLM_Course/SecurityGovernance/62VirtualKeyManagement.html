<h1>Enterprise-Grade Virtual Key Management</h1>

<p>In a large organization, sharing a single master API key for OpenAI or Anthropic is a major security risk and an administrative nightmare. The LiteLLM Proxy solves this through the use of "Virtual Keys," which act as an abstraction layer between your applications and the underlying model providers.</p>

<h2>6.2 What are Virtual Keys?</h2>
<p>A virtual key is a unique string generated by the LiteLLM Proxy. Applications use this key to make requests to the proxy, and the proxy then maps that virtual key to the appropriate master key(s) for the backend models.</p>

<h2>6.3 Key Features of Virtual Keys</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Granular Permissions:</strong> You can restrict a virtual key to only allow access to specific models (e.g., "this key can only call GPT-4o-mini").</li>
    <li><strong>Budgeting and Quotas:</strong> You can set a maximum spend or token limit for each virtual key (e.g., "this key has a $10/day budget").</li>
    <li><strong>Usage Attribution:</strong> Every request made with a virtual key is logged and attributed to that key, allowing for detailed internal billing and chargebacks.</li>
    <li><strong>Time-Bound Access:</strong> You can set an expiration date for a virtual key, perfect for temporary projects or contract developers.</li>
    <li><strong>Revocation:</strong> If a virtual key is compromised, it can be instantly revoked without affecting any other applications or requiring you to rotate your master API keys.</li>
</ul>

<h2>6.4 Implementing RBAC with Virtual Keys</h2>
<p>By associating virtual keys with specific users or teams, you can implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for your AI resources.
<ul>
    <li><strong>Developer Role:</strong> Keys with access to small, cheap models for testing.</li>
    <li><strong>Production Role:</strong> Keys with access to larger, more expensive models with high rate limits.</li>
    <li><strong>Finance Role:</strong> Keys with access to specialized models for sensitive data analysis.</li>
</ul></p>

<h2>6.5 Automating Key Management</h2>
<p>The LiteLLM Proxy provides a REST API for managing virtual keys. This allows you to integrate key management into your existing internal developer portal or CI/CD pipelines:
<pre><code># Example: Creating a new virtual key via API
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/key/generate \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer master-proxy-key" \
     -d '{
       "models": ["gpt-4o", "claude-3-5-sonnet"],
       "max_budget": 50.0,
       "user_id": "team-alpha"
     }'</code></pre>
</p>

<h2>6.6 Secure Storage of Virtual Keys</h2>
<p>While the virtual keys themselves are generated and managed by the proxy, they should be treated with the same care as traditional API keys. Applications should store them in secure environment variables or secret management systems (like AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault).</p>

<p>By moving to a virtual key architecture, you gain unprecedented control, visibility, and security over your organization's AI usage, enabling you to scale AI innovation safely and responsibly.</p>
