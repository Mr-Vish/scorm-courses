<h1>OpenRouter Rankings: Data-Driven Model Selection</h1>

<p>With hundreds of models available on OpenRouter, choosing the right one for your application can be daunting. OpenRouter provides a unique "Rankings" system that uses real-world usage and performance data to help you identify the best models for different categories of tasks. This module explores how to use these rankings to optimize your model selection.</p>

<h2>1.2 The OpenRouter Ranking Methodology</h2>
<p>OpenRouter's rankings are not based on subjective opinions but on aggregated data from millions of requests:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Usage Volume:</strong> How many tokens are being processed by this model across all OpenRouter users? High volume usually indicates a stable and cost-effective model.</li>
    <li><strong>Latency:</strong> What is the average time-to-first-token and total response time for this model?</li>
    <li><strong>Reliability:</strong> What is the success rate (200 OK responses) for this model across all its providers?</li>
    <li><strong>Cost-Performance Ratio:</strong> How much do you get for your money? This is especially useful for identifying high-quality open-source models (like Llama 3) that are significantly cheaper than proprietary ones.</li>
</ul></p>

<h2>1.3 Top Model Categories on OpenRouter</h2>
<p>OpenRouter categorizes models into several tiers to help you narrow your search:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Frontier Models:</strong> The absolute best-performing models in the world (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet). These are most expensive but have the highest reasoning capabilities.</li>
    <li><strong>Mid-Tier Models:</strong> Excellent balance of speed and intelligence (e.g., Claude 3 Haiku, GPT-4o-mini, Mistral Large). Ideal for most general-purpose chat and analysis tasks.</li>
    <li><strong>Small/Fast Models:</strong> Optimized for extremely low latency and low cost (e.g., Llama 3 8B, Gemma 2 9B). Perfect for simple tasks like classification, summarization, or routing.</li>
    <li><strong>Specialized Models:</strong> Models trained for specific tasks like coding (CodeLlama, DeepSeek Coder) or medical analysis.</li>
</ul></p>

<h2>1.4 The "Auto" Model Feature</h2>
<p>OpenRouter offers a special <code>openrouter/auto</code> model ID. When you call this, OpenRouter uses its internal intelligence to route your request to the best-performing and most cost-effective model for your specific prompt at that moment. This is the ultimate "no-config" way to get started with multi-model AI.</p>

<h2>1.5 Discovery via the OpenRouter UI</h2>
<p>The OpenRouter website provides an interactive explorer where you can filter models by provider, context window size, pricing (per 1k tokens), and performance benchmarks (like MMLU or HumanEval). This allows your team to perform "A/B testing" on different models before committing to one in your application code.</p>

<p>By leveraging the data-driven insights from OpenRouter's rankings, you can move beyond guesswork and build AI applications that are powered by the most efficient and effective models available on the market.</p>
