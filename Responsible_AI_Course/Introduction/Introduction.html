<h1>Introduction to Responsible AI</h1>

<div class="intro-section">
<p>Welcome to <strong>Responsible AI: Ethics, Governance, and Safety</strong>. As Artificial Intelligence becomes more integrated into our societies, economies, and personal lives, the question of <em>how</em> we build these systems is becoming just as important as <em>what</em> they can do. This course is designed to provide you with the framework, tools, and practical knowledge to ensure that the AI systems you develop and deploy are fair, safe, transparent, and aligned with human values.</p>

<h2>The Ethics of the AI Era</h2>
<p>We are currently witnessing a "Cambrian Explosion" of AI capabilities. Models can now generate human-like text, create stunning artwork, and solve complex scientific problems. But this rapid progress has outpaced our social and legal frameworks. Responsible AI is the field dedicated to closing that gap, ensuring that AI remains a force for good while minimizing the risks of bias, misinformation, and harm.</p>

<h2>What You'll Learn</h2>
<p>This course is structured to take you from foundational principles to advanced technical implementation:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Module 1: Safety Fundamentals:</strong> We'll explore why responsibility is an imperative for any modern AI organization and dive deep into the mechanics of <strong>Bias Detection and Mitigation</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>Module 2: Governance and Red Teaming:</strong> Learn how to build an organizational <strong>Governance Framework</strong> and how to proactively stress-test your models through <strong>Adversarial Red Teaming</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>Module 3: Explainability and Interpretability:</strong> Understand how to look inside the "black box" and provide understandable reasons for AI decisions.</li>
    <li><strong>Module 4: Privacy and Data Protection:</strong> Master the techniques for protecting user data, including Differential Privacy and PII redaction.</li>
    <li><strong>Module 5: Regulatory Compliance:</strong> Get up to speed on the global legal landscape, including the landmark <strong>EU AI Act</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Course Structure</h2>
<p>Each module combines theoretical depth with practical case studies and technical examples in Python. You will see how safety concepts are translated into code through "guardrail" implementations and automated testing loops. At the end of each module, you will find practice questions, followed by a final comprehensive assessment.</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>This course is designed for a broad audience, including software engineers, data scientists, product managers, and legal professionals. While some technical examples are provided in Python, the core concepts are accessible to anyone interested in the future of ethical technology.</p>

<h2>How to Navigate</h2>
<p>Use the <strong>Next</strong> and <strong>Previous</strong> buttons at the bottom right to move through the modules. Your progress is saved automatically, so you can resume your learning at any time. We recommend following the sequence of modules to build a comprehensive understanding of the subject.</p>

<p>Let's begin our journey into the vital world of Responsible AI.</p>
