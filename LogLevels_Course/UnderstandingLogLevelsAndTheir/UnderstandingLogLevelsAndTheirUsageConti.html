<h1>Understanding Log Levels and Their Usage (Continued)</h1>

<ol>
    <li><strong>INFO</strong>: <strong>Confirmation that things are working</strong> as expected. This level provides general application health and progress messages, such as service startup/shutdown, major state changes, or successful key operations. This is often the <strong>default level</strong> for production environments.</li>
    <li><strong>WARN</strong>: <strong>Potentially harmful situations</strong> or unexpected events that might indicate a problem but do not necessarily prevent the application from continuing. Examples include use of deprecated APIs, hitting a soft limit, or a recoverable failure.</li>
    <li><strong>ERROR</strong>: <strong>Serious errors</strong> that prevent certain parts of the application from functioning, but the application as a whole might still be running. Examples are exceptions that cause a feature to fail.</li>
    <li><strong>FATAL</strong>: <strong>Very severe error events</strong> that will likely cause the application to abort. This is usually reserved for catastrophic failures that bring down the entire system or a critical component.</li>
</ol>
