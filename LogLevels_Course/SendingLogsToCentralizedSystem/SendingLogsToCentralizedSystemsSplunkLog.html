<h1>Sending Logs to Centralized Systems (Splunk, LogicMonitor, etc.)</h1>

<p>To leverage the power of <strong>Centralized Logging Systems</strong> (Splunk, LogicMonitor, ELK Stack), you must configure your logging framework (Log4j, Logback) to direct output to them. This is done via <strong>Appenders (or Handlers)</strong> in your external configuration file.</p>

<h3>1. The Robust Approach: File-Based Logging with an Agent (Recommended)</h3>

<p>This is the most common and reliable method, favored by large-scale deployments:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Application Action</strong>: The application uses a standard <strong>RollingFileAppender</strong> to write highly structured logs (preferably JSON) to a local file.</li>
    <li><strong>Agent Action</strong>: A dedicated, lightweight log forwarding agent (e.g., <strong>Splunk Universal Forwarder</strong>, <strong>LogicMonitor Collector</strong>, Fluentd) runs on the same server.</li>
    <li><strong>Shipping</strong>: The agent is configured to <strong>&quot;tail&quot;</strong> (monitor) the application&#x27;s log file, read new entries in real-time, and forward them over the network to the central log aggregator.</li>
</ul>
