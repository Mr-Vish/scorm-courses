<h1>RLHF and DPO - Aligning Language Models with Human Preferences</h1>

<div class="intro-section">
<p>Welcome to the comprehensive course on <strong>RLHF and DPO: Aligning Language Models with Human Preferences</strong>. In the rapidly evolving landscape of Artificial Intelligence, the ability to build massive models is only half the battle. The more critical, and often more difficult, challenge is ensuring these models behave in ways that are helpful, safe, and aligned with human values. This course is designed to take you from the fundamental concepts of alignment to the cutting-edge techniques used by the world's leading AI labs.</p>

<h2>The Evolution of Language Modeling</h2>
<p>For years, the focus of NLP was on "pre-training"—teaching models to predict the next word in a sequence using vast amounts of internet data. While this created models with incredible knowledge, it did not create "assistants." A base model might respond to a question with more questions, or it might generate factually correct but highly biased or offensive content. The "Alignment Phase" is what transformed these raw engines into the conversational partners we use today, like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini.</p>

<h2>What You'll Learn</h2>
<p>This course is structured to provide both theoretical depth and practical implementation knowledge. We have divided the curriculum into several deep-dive modules:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Module 1: Reward Modeling and PPO:</strong> Understand the classic three-stage RLHF pipeline. We'll explore Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), the mechanics of training a Reward Model, and the intricacies of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).</li>
    <li><strong>Module 2: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO):</strong> Learn about the breakthrough method that simplified alignment. We'll dive into the math of DPO and see why it's becoming the preferred choice for many developers.</li>
    <li><strong>Module 3: Advanced Alignment Techniques:</strong> Explore the "post-DPO" world, including KTO (Kahneman-Tversky Optimization), ORPO, and SimPO. We'll discuss how to choose the right algorithm for your specific use case.</li>
    <li><strong>Module 4: Constitutional AI and RLAIF:</strong> Discover how we can use AI to align AI. We'll study Anthropic's "Constitution" approach and see how Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) is solving the scalability problem of human labeling.</li>
    <li><strong>Module 5: Evaluation and Benchmarking:</strong> Learn how to prove your model is actually better. We'll cover "LLM-as-a-Judge," the LMSYS Chatbot Arena, and how to measure the "Alignment Tax."</li>
</ul>

<h2>Course Structure</h2>
<p>The course consists of detailed technical articles, code examples in Python (using libraries like Hugging Face TRL and Transformers), and comparative analyses of different methodologies. At the end of the course, you will find a comprehensive final assessment to test your mastery of these concepts.</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>To get the most out of this course, you should have a solid understanding of:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Deep Learning fundamentals (Neural Networks, Backpropagation).</li>
    <li>The Transformer architecture (Attention mechanisms).</li>
    <li>Python programming and basic familiarity with the Hugging Face ecosystem.</li>
    <li>Basic probability and statistics (useful for understanding RL objectives).</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Navigate</h2>
<p>Use the <strong>Next</strong> and <strong>Previous</strong> buttons at the bottom right to move through the modules. We recommend following the sequence as each module builds upon the concepts of the previous one. Your progress is saved automatically via the SCORM framework, allowing you to learn at your own pace.</p>

<p>Let's begin the journey of mastering AI alignment!</p>
