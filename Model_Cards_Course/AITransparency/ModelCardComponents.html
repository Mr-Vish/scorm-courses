<h1>Model Card Components and Examples</h1>


<h2>What is a Model Card?</h2>
<p>A model card is a standardized document that describes a machine learning model's intended use, performance characteristics, limitations, and ethical considerations. Introduced by Google researchers in 2019, model cards are now an industry standard for AI transparency.</p>

<h2>Model Card Sections</h2>

<pre><code># Model Card: Customer Intent Classifier v2.1

## Model Details
- **Name:** CustomerIntentClassifier-v2.1
- **Type:** Fine-tuned BERT for multi-class text classification
- **Version:** 2.1 (released 2025-01-15)
- **Base model:** bert-base-uncased
- **Owner:** AI Platform Team
- **License:** Internal use only

## Intended Use
- **Primary use:** Classify customer support messages into intent categories
- **Users:** Customer support routing system
- **Out of scope:** General text classification, sentiment analysis, languages other than English

## Training Data
- **Source:** 50,000 labeled customer support messages (Jan 2023 - Dec 2024)
- **Labels:** 15 intent categories (billing, technical, account, etc.)
- **Preprocessing:** Lowercased, PII redacted, duplicates removed
- **Known gaps:** Limited data for "compliance" and "partnership" intents

## Performance
- **Overall accuracy:** 94.2% (test set, n=5,000)
- **Lowest class accuracy:** "compliance" at 78% (limited training data)
- **Highest class accuracy:** "billing" at 98.1% (most training data)
- **Latency:** p50=12ms, p99=45ms

## Limitations
- English only - does not support multilingual input
- Accuracy drops below 85% for messages under 10 words
- May misclassify when customers describe multiple issues
- Not trained on emerging product categories</code></pre>

<h2>Hugging Face Model Cards</h2>
<p>Hugging Face uses model cards as the standard documentation format for all models on the Hub. Every model repository includes a README.md that serves as its model card:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Displayed prominently on the model page</li>
    <li>Supports rich markdown with tables, images, and widgets</li>
    <li>Includes structured metadata (language, license, tags, datasets)</li>
    <li>Community can raise issues and suggest improvements</li>
</ul>
