<h1>Model Cards and AI Transparency Reporting</h1>

<div class="intro-section">
<h2>Course Overview</h2>
<p>Welcome to <strong>Model Cards and AI Transparency Reporting</strong>, a comprehensive enterprise-level course designed to equip you with the knowledge and skills necessary to document, evaluate, and communicate AI model capabilities, limitations, and ethical considerations in professional settings.</p>

<p>As artificial intelligence systems become increasingly integrated into business operations, healthcare, finance, and public services, the need for transparent, accountable, and well-documented AI systems has never been more critical. This course addresses this need by providing you with industry-standard frameworks and best practices for AI transparency.</p>

<h2>Purpose and Relevance</h2>
<p>Model cards serve as standardized documentation that enables stakeholders—including developers, business leaders, compliance officers, and end users—to understand what an AI model does, how it performs, where it may fail, and what ethical considerations must be addressed. This course is essential for:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Regulatory Compliance:</strong> Meeting emerging AI regulations such as the EU AI Act, which mandates transparency and documentation</li>
    <li><strong>Risk Management:</strong> Identifying and mitigating potential harms before deployment</li>
    <li><strong>Stakeholder Communication:</strong> Providing clear, accessible information to technical and non-technical audiences</li>
    <li><strong>Ethical AI Development:</strong> Ensuring responsible AI practices throughout the development lifecycle</li>
    <li><strong>Trust Building:</strong> Establishing credibility and accountability with users and regulators</li>
</ul>

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
<p>By the end of this course, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Understand the purpose, structure, and components of model cards as standardized AI documentation</li>
    <li>Create comprehensive model cards that meet industry standards and regulatory requirements</li>
    <li>Identify, measure, and document various types of bias in AI systems</li>
    <li>Conduct disaggregated evaluations to assess model performance across demographic groups</li>
    <li>Implement fairness metrics and bias mitigation strategies</li>
    <li>Document model limitations, failure modes, and out-of-scope use cases</li>
    <li>Establish AI governance frameworks and transparency reporting processes</li>
    <li>Apply best practices for ongoing model monitoring and documentation updates</li>
    <li>Communicate AI capabilities and risks effectively to diverse stakeholders</li>
</ul>

<h2>Expected Learner Outcomes</h2>
<p>Upon successful completion of this course, learners will:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Possess the skills to create production-ready model cards for real-world AI systems</li>
