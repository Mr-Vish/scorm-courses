## Key Concepts Covered

### Cost & Performance
- Token economics and pricing models
- Latency impact on user experience
- ROI calculation (target: 3-10x)
- Cost savings analysis

### Caching Strategies
- Exact match caching (SHA-256 hashing)
- Semantic caching (embeddings, vector similarity)
- Provider-native caching (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google)
- Hybrid multi-tier approaches

### Architecture Patterns
- Application-level caching
- Proxy/gateway caching
- Sidecar caching
- Distributed cache clusters

### Technologies
- Redis (primary cache storage)
- Vector databases (Pinecone, Weaviate, Qdrant)
- Embedding models (OpenAI, Sentence Transformers)
- Managed services (ElastiCache, Azure Cache, Memorystore)

### Best Practices
- TTL configuration by content type
- Cache invalidation strategies
- Security and encryption (AES-256)
- Monitoring metrics (hit rate, latency, cost)
- Production deployment (phased rollout)
