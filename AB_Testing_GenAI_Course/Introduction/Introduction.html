<h1>A/B Testing for GenAI Features</h1>

<div class="intro-section">

<h2>Course Overview</h2>
<p>Welcome to <strong>A/B Testing for GenAI Features</strong>, a comprehensive enterprise-level course designed to equip you with the knowledge and skills to design, implement, and analyze controlled experiments for Generative AI applications. As organizations increasingly integrate GenAI capabilities into their products, the ability to rigorously test and validate these features becomes critical for ensuring user satisfaction, operational efficiency, and business success.</p>

<p>This course bridges the gap between traditional A/B testing methodologies and the unique challenges posed by non-deterministic AI systems. You will learn how to navigate the complexities of testing large language models, evaluate subjective outputs, and make data-driven decisions in environments where variability is inherent.</p>

<h2>Purpose and Relevance</h2>
<p>Generative AI features introduce unprecedented uncertainty into product development. Unlike traditional software where outputs are deterministic and predictable, GenAI systems can produce vastly different results based on model selection, prompt engineering, temperature settings, and retrieval configurations. This variability makes it essential to employ rigorous experimentation frameworks.</p>

<p>A/B testing provides the empirical foundation needed to answer critical questions such as:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Which language model delivers superior user satisfaction for our specific use case?</li>
    <li>How do different prompt formulations impact output quality and task completion rates?</li>
    <li>What RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) configuration optimizes accuracy without degrading latency?</li>
    <li>Does streaming responses improve perceived performance compared to complete generation?</li>
</ul>

<p>By mastering A/B testing for GenAI, you will be able to systematically optimize AI features, reduce deployment risks, and demonstrate measurable business impact through controlled experimentation.</p>

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
<p>Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Design rigorous A/B experiments</strong> tailored to the unique characteristics of GenAI systems, including proper variant definition, traffic allocation, and statistical power calculations</li>
    <li><strong>Identify and measure appropriate metrics</strong> for GenAI features, spanning quality assessments, user behavior signals, engagement patterns, and operational constraints</li>
    <li><strong>Implement automated evaluation frameworks</strong> using LLM-as-judge methodologies while understanding and mitigating common biases</li>
    <li><strong>Conduct statistical analysis</strong> of experiment results, including hypothesis testing, effect size calculation, and confidence interval estimation</li>
    <li><strong>Evaluate trade-offs</strong> between competing objectives such as output quality, latency, cost, and safety in GenAI deployments</li>
    <li><strong>Apply best practices</strong> for experiment design, including guardrail metrics, pre-registration of hypotheses, and proper documentation</li>
</ul>

<h2>Expected Learner Outcomes</h2>
<p>By the end of this course, learners will have developed practical competencies in:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Formulating testable hypotheses for GenAI feature improvements</li>
    <li>Selecting appropriate experimental designs and sample sizes for statistical validity</li>
    <li>Implementing deterministic user assignment algorithms for consistent experiment experiences</li>
    <li>Collecting and analyzing both quantitative metrics and qualitative user feedback</li>
    <li>Interpreting statistical significance in the context of practical business impact</li>
    <li>Communicating experiment results and recommendations to technical and non-technical stakeholders</li>
</ul>

<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>This course is designed for:</p>

<h2>Course Structure</h2>
<p>This course is organized into <strong>3 comprehensive modules</strong>, each followed by an assessment to validate your understanding:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Module 1: Fundamentals of A/B Testing for GenAI</strong> - Experiment design principles, metric selection, and sample size determination</li>
    <li><strong>Module 2: Evaluation Methodologies and Statistical Analysis</strong> - LLM-as-judge frameworks, bias mitigation, and hypothesis testing</li>
    <li><strong>Module 3: Advanced Techniques and Best Practices</strong> - Multi-armed bandits, guardrail metrics, and production deployment strategies</li>
</ul>

<p>Each module contains detailed explanations, real-world examples, and practical implementation guidance. Assessments require a minimum score of <strong>70%</strong> to proceed to the next module.</p>

<h2>How to Navigate</h2>
<p>Use the <strong>Next</strong> and <strong>Previous</strong> buttons at the bottom right to move through the course content. Your progress is automatically saved, allowing you to resume where you left off if you exit and return later. Complete each module's content before attempting its assessment.</p>

<p>We recommend dedicating focused time to each module and taking notes on key concepts and implementation patterns that are relevant to your specific use cases.</p>
