<h1>Pattern: Agentic RAG</h1>
<div class="container">
<h2>Agentic RAG: Intelligent, Multi-Step Retrieval</h2>
<p>While standard RAG is a linear "Retrieve -> Augment -> Generate" pipeline, <strong>Agentic RAG</strong> transforms retrieval into a dynamic, iterative process. In Agentic RAG, an AI agent is given a goal and a set of tools (including search tools) and is allowed to decide which information it needs, how to find it, and when it has enough to answer the user.</p>

<h3>The Problem with Linear RAG</h3>
<p>Linear RAG assumes that a single search will always find the right information. However, for many complex questions, you don't know what to search for until you've already found some initial information. Linear RAG struggles with "exploratory" or "multi-step" research tasks.</p>

<h3>How Agentic RAG Works</h3>
<p>Agentic RAG typically uses the <strong>ReAct</strong> pattern (Reason + Act). The agent follows this cycle:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Analyze:</strong> The agent looks at the user's question and thinks: "What information am I missing to answer this?"</li>
    <li><strong>Act:</strong> The agent calls a retrieval tool. "Search for '2024 revenue projections for Company X'."</li>
    <li><strong>Observe:</strong> The agent reads the search results. "I found the revenue, but I also see a mention of a recent merger. I need to know more about that merger to give a complete answer."</li>
    <li><strong>Repeat:</strong> The agent performs a *second* search for the merger.</li>
    <li><strong>Synthesize:</strong> Once the agent has all the pieces, it formulates the final answer.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Key Components of Agentic RAG</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Multi-Tool Access:</strong> The agent might have access to vector search, a SQL database, a web search API, and a calculator. It chooses the best tool for each sub-task.</li>
    <li><strong>Self-Correction:</strong> If a search returns no results or irrelevant results, the agent can "think" of a better query and try again.</li>
    <li><strong>Reasoning over Long Context:</strong> The agent maintains a memory of what it has found so far, allowing it to connect the dots across different retrieval steps.</li>
    <li><strong>Termination Logic:</strong> The agent must be smart enough to know when it has sufficient information, preventing infinite loops.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Benefits of Agentic RAG</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Handles Complex, Ambiguous Queries:</strong> Perfect for research, troubleshooting, and planning tasks.</li>
    <li><strong>Significantly Higher Accuracy:</strong> By iteratively refining its search, the agent is much more likely to find the "hidden" facts.</li>
    <li><strong>Adaptability:</strong> The same agent can handle a wide variety of tasks without needing a custom pipeline for each one.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Cost and Latency Tradeoff</h3>
<p>Agentic RAG is the most powerful RAG pattern, but it's also the most "expensive."
<ul>
    <li><strong>Latency:</strong> Multiple rounds of reasoning and action can take 30-60 seconds or more.</li>
    <li><strong>Token Usage:</strong> Each step in the agent's "thought process" adds to the total token count.</li>
    <li><strong>Complexity:</strong> Building reliable agents that don't get stuck in loops requires advanced prompting and robust error handling.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Use Case: Competitive Intelligence</h3>
<p>User: "Compare the pricing of our product with our top three competitors and highlight any areas where we are significantly more expensive."
The Agentic RAG system:
1. Identifies the top 3 competitors.
2. Searches for the pricing of each competitor individually.
3. Searches for our own product's latest pricing.
4. Identifies that one competitor has a complex "tiered" pricing model and does a follow-up search to understand the tiers.
5. Performs a final comparison and generates the report.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Agentic RAG is the future of information retrieval. It moves us away from "keyword matching" and towards "intelligent research." While more complex to build, Agentic RAG systems provide a level of autonomy and depth that makes them truly transformative for professional workflows.</p>
