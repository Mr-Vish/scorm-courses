<h1>Pattern: Multimodal RAG</h1>
<div class="container">
<h2>Multimodal RAG: Retrieving Beyond Text</h2>
<p>Modern AI applications often need to process more than just text. They need to "understand" images, videos, and audio. <strong>Multimodal RAG</strong> is the pattern that allows you to store and retrieve these different types of data alongside your text documents, enabling a truly comprehensive knowledge base.</p>

<h3>The Challenge of Multimodal Data</h3>
<p>How do you compare a user's text question ("Find me a photo of a red car") with an actual image of a red car? You need a way to map both text and images into the same "Vector Space."</p>

<h3>CLIP: The Bridge Between Text and Vision</h3>
<p>The most common way to build multimodal RAG is using a model like <strong>CLIP</strong> (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training).
<ul>
    <li><strong>Joint Embedding Space:</strong> CLIP is trained on millions of image-text pairs. It learns to create a single vector space where an image of a dog and the word "dog" are very close to each other.</li>
    <li><strong>Retrieval:</strong> In a multimodal RAG system, you embed your images using CLIP's image encoder and your user's text query using CLIP's text encoder. You can then perform a standard vector search to find the most relevant images.</li>
</ul></p>

<h3>Types of Multimodal RAG</h3>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Text-to-Image Retrieval:</strong> User types text, system finds images. (e.g., a stock photo search engine).</li>
    <li><strong>Image-to-Text Retrieval:</strong> User uploads an image, system finds relevant text documents. (e.g., "Find the repair manual for this part").</li>
    <li><strong>Multimodal-to-Multimodal:</strong> User provides both text and an image, and the system finds relevant content of any type. (e.g., "Find more products that look like this image but are made of wood").</li>
</ol>

<h3>Architecture of a Multimodal RAG Pipeline</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Storage:</strong> A vector database that can store high-dimensional embeddings from multimodal models.</li>
    <li><strong>Retrieval Engine:</strong> Capable of handling different types of input queries (text, image, or both).</li>
    <li><strong>Synthesis Model:</strong> A multimodal LLM (like Claude 3.5 Sonnet) that can "see" the retrieved images and "read" the retrieved text to formulate a final answer.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Use Case: Industrial Maintenance Assistant</h3>
<p>A technician in a factory sees a broken gear.
1. The technician takes a photo of the gear and asks: "How do I replace this?"
2. The Multimodal RAG system embeds the photo and the text query.
3. It retrieves:
   - A technical diagram of the specific gear (Image).
   - The "Replacement Procedure" section from the maintenance manual (Text).
   - A video snippet of a previous repair (Video metadata).
4. Claude analyzes all these sources and provides a step-by-step guide with visual callouts from the diagram.</p>

<h3>Key Considerations for Multimodal RAG</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Embedding Quality:</strong> The "bridge" model (like CLIP) must be powerful enough to capture the subtle details in your specific domain (e.g., medical images vs. satellite photos).</li>
    <li><strong>Cost and Latency:</strong> Multimodal embeddings and multimodal LLM calls are significantly more expensive and slower than text-only versions.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Privacy:</strong> Storing and processing images and video often involves stricter privacy and security requirements than text.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Multimodal RAG is the final piece of the puzzle for building "all-seeing" AI assistants. By breaking the barrier between text and vision, we can create systems that interact with the world in a way that is much more natural and powerful for humans.</p>
