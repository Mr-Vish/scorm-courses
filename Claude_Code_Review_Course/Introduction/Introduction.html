<h1>AI-Powered Code Review and Automated Refactoring with Claude</h1>

<div class="intro-section">

<h2>Course Overview</h2>
<p>Welcome to this comprehensive course on AI-Powered Code Review and Automated Refactoring using Claude. In today's fast-paced software development environment, maintaining code quality while accelerating delivery timelines presents a significant challenge. This course explores how artificial intelligence, specifically Claude AI, revolutionizes the code review process by providing intelligent, context-aware analysis that enhances both code quality and developer productivity.</p>

<p>Traditional code review processes, while valuable, often suffer from inconsistency, time constraints, and human oversight limitations. AI-powered code review addresses these challenges by providing systematic, comprehensive analysis that complements human expertise. This course will equip you with the knowledge and skills to leverage Claude AI for automated code review, intelligent refactoring, and continuous quality improvement in enterprise software development environments.</p>
