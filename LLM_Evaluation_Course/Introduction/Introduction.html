<h1>Evaluating LLM Output Quality - Metrics, Rubrics, and Human Eval</h1>

<div class="intro-section">
<p>Welcome to <strong>Evaluating LLM Output Quality - Metrics, Rubrics, and Human Eval</strong>. As Large Language Models (LLMs) move from prototypes to production, systematic evaluation becomes the critical bridge between "it seems to work" and "it is reliable." This course explores the methodologies, metrics, and frameworks required to rigorously assess model performance.</p>

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Understand the difference between reference-based (BLEU/ROUGE) and reference-free (LLM-as-Judge) evaluation.</li>
    <li>Identify appropriate benchmarks for common LLM tasks like reasoning, coding, and summarization.</li>
    <li>Design robust human evaluation rubrics to capture nuances that automated metrics miss.</li>
    <li>Implement strategies to detect and mitigate hallucinations and biases in model outputs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Intended Audience</h2>
<p>This course is designed for AI Engineers, Data Scientists, and Product Managers who are responsible for the quality and safety of LLM-powered applications.</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Basic understanding of Large Language Models and prompt engineering.</li>
    <li>Familiarity with standard machine learning concepts (precision, recall, etc.) is helpful but not required.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What You'll Learn</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Module 1:</strong> LLM Evaluation Methods (Automated Metrics, Benchmarks, and Human Evaluation)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Course Structure</h2>
<p>This course contains <strong>1 module</strong> with <strong>2 in-depth content pages</strong>, followed by assessments to test your understanding. You need to score 70% or higher on each assessment to proceed.</p>

<h2>How to Navigate</h2>
<p>Use the <strong>Next</strong> and <strong>Previous</strong> buttons at the bottom right to move through the course.
Your progress is saved automatically, so you can resume where you left off if you exit and return later.</p>
