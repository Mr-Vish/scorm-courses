<h1>Hugging Face Transformers - From Download to Deployment</h1>

<h2>Course Overview</h2>
<p>Welcome to <strong>Hugging Face Transformers - From Download to Deployment</strong>. This comprehensive course guides you through the complete lifecycle of working with transformer models using the Hugging Face ecosystem. You'll learn to leverage pre-trained models, optimize inference performance, and deploy production-ready AI applications.</p>

<p>The Hugging Face Transformers library has revolutionized how developers work with state-of-the-art NLP and multimodal models. With over 500,000 models available on the Hub, understanding how to effectively download, configure, optimize, and deploy these models is essential for modern AI development.</p>

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
<p>By the end of this course, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Navigate the Hugging Face Model Hub and select appropriate models for specific tasks</li>
    <li>Implement the Pipeline API for rapid prototyping and common NLP tasks</li>
    <li>Work with tokenizers to manage context windows and understand token-level operations</li>
    <li>Apply optimization techniques including quantization, Flash Attention, and batched inference</li>
    <li>Configure and control text generation with sampling parameters</li>
    <li>Fine-tune pre-trained models for custom tasks using the Trainer API</li>
    <li>Deploy models to production using various deployment strategies</li>
    <li>Evaluate model performance and make informed trade-offs between speed, memory, and quality</li>
</ul>
