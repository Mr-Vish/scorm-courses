<h1>Spring AI RAG Tutorial: Build a Context-Aware Application</h1>

<p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a pattern that enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by providing them with external, up-to-date, or proprietary data, which reduces <strong>hallucinations</strong> and grounds the response in facts. Spring AI provides an idiomatic and seamless way to implement RAG within the Spring Boot ecosystem.</p>

<h3><strong>Introduction: Spring AI vs. LangChain</strong></h3>

<p><strong>Spring AI</strong> is a framework that aims to apply Spring ecosystem design principles—such as <strong>portability</strong> (across models and vector stores) and <strong>modular design</strong>—to the AI domain. It is a natural choice for <strong>Java/Spring Boot developers</strong> as it fully embraces Spring conventions like <strong>Dependency Injection</strong>, auto-configuration, and POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects).</p>

<p>Spring AI can be a strong alternative to LangChain (and its Java port, LangChain4j) for RAG, especially within an enterprise setting, because:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Seamless Spring Boot Integration:</strong> It uses Spring Boot starters, making setup incredibly fast. You get an automatically configured ChatClient and VectorStore by simply adding dependencies and properties.</li>
    <li><strong>Idiomatic Java:</strong> The APIs feel like other Spring APIs (like WebClient or JdbcTemplate), leveraging familiar patterns for Java developers.</li>
    <li><strong>Enterprise-Grade Features:</strong> It is backed by the Spring ecosystem, inheriting robust features like observability, security, and consistent configuration.</li>
    <li><strong>Focus on Abstraction:</strong> It provides high-level abstractions like the Advisor API for RAG, which encapsulates the entire retrieval and prompt augmentation logic, often requiring less boilerplate than manually stitching together a chain.</li>
</ul>
