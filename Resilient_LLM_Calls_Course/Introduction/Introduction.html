<h1>Building Resilient LLM Applications</h1>

<div class="intro-section">
<p>Welcome to <strong>Building Resilient LLM Applications</strong>. In the era of Generative AI, the "happy path" of software development—where APIs are always available and responses are near-instant—is a myth. Developing professional-grade AI applications requires a deep understanding of how to handle high latency, unpredictable rate limits, and transient outages from third-party model providers.</p>

<h2>The Challenge of LLM Reliability</h2>
<p>Unlike traditional REST APIs that might handle thousands of requests per second with millisecond latency, LLMs are computationally expensive and slow. A single request can take seconds or even minutes to complete. This creates unique challenges for system stability. If your application isn't designed for these realities, a simple spike in traffic or a brief provider slowdown can lead to cascading failures that bring down your entire service.</p>

<h2>What You'll Learn</h2>
<p>This course provides a comprehensive toolkit for building robust, production-ready AI systems. We will cover:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Module 1: Rate Limiting and Backoff:</strong> Learn how to handle 429 errors gracefully using exponential backoff with jitter and proactive client-side throttling.</li>
    <li><strong>Module 2: Circuit Breakers and Fallbacks:</strong> Master the patterns that prevent system collapse. Learn how to automatically switch models or providers when failures occur.</li>
    <li><strong>Module 3: Advanced Resilience Patterns:</strong> Explore bulkheads, load balancing, and timeout management strategies specifically tuned for long-running LLM calls.</li>
    <li><strong>Module 4: Monitoring and Observability:</strong> Understand how to track token usage, latency distributions, and error rates to identify bottlenecks before they impact users.</li>
    <li><strong>Module 5: Cost and Performance Optimization:</strong> Balance the trade-offs between model quality, response speed, and budget.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Course Structure</h2>
<p>The course is divided into technical modules, each focusing on a specific set of patterns and their practical implementation in Python. We will look at real-world code examples and architectural diagrams to illustrate these concepts.</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>This course is designed for software engineers and architects. Familiarity with Python and basic web API concepts is assumed. No prior experience with specific LLM providers is required, though we will use OpenAI and Anthropic as examples throughout.</p>

<h2>How to Navigate</h2>
<p>Use the <strong>Next</strong> and <strong>Previous</strong> buttons to move through the course. Each module ends with a set of practice questions to reinforce your understanding. A final comprehensive assessment will test your ability to apply these patterns in a production scenario.</p>

<p>Let's build systems that don't just work—systems that endure.</p>
