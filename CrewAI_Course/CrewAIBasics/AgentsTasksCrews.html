<h1>Agents, Tasks, and Crews</h1>


<h2>What is CrewAI?</h2>
<p>CrewAI is a Python framework for orchestrating multiple AI agents that collaborate like a team of specialists. Each agent has a defined role, goal, and backstory, making the system intuitive to design and debug. Think of it as building a virtual team where each member has a specific job.</p>

<h2>Core Concepts</h2>
<table>
    <tr><th>Concept</th><th>Description</th><th>Real-World Analogy</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Agent</td><td>An autonomous unit with a role, goal, and tools</td><td>A team member with a job title</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Task</td><td>A specific piece of work assigned to an agent</td><td>A ticket or work item</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Crew</td><td>A group of agents working together on tasks</td><td>A project team</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Process</td><td>How tasks are executed (sequential or hierarchical)</td><td>A workflow or methodology</td></tr>
</table>

<h2>Defining Agents</h2>
<div class="code-block">
<pre><code>from crewai import Agent

researcher = Agent(
    role="Senior Research Analyst",
    goal="Find and analyze the latest AI industry trends",
    backstory="You are an experienced research analyst with 10 years in tech.",
    verbose=True,
    allow_delegation=True,
    llm="gpt-4o",
)

writer = Agent(
    role="Technical Writer",
    goal="Write clear, engaging articles about AI trends",
    backstory="You are a skilled writer who makes complex topics accessible.",
    verbose=True,
    allow_delegation=False,
    llm="gpt-4o",
)</code></pre>
</div>

<h2>Defining Tasks and Crews</h2>
<div class="code-block">
<pre><code>from crewai import Task, Crew, Process

research_task = Task(
    description="Research the top 5 AI trends for 2025. Include market data.",
    expected_output="A detailed report with 5 trends, each with data and analysis.",
    agent=researcher,
)

writing_task = Task(
    description="Write a blog post based on the research report.",
    expected_output="A 1000-word blog post in markdown format.",
    agent=writer,
    context=[research_task],  # Gets output from research_task
)

# Assemble the crew
crew = Crew(
    agents=[researcher, writer],
    tasks=[research_task, writing_task],
    process=Process.sequential,  # Tasks run in order
    verbose=True,
)

# Kick off the work
result = crew.kickoff()
print(result)</code></pre>
</div>

<h2>Process Types</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Sequential:</strong> Tasks execute one after another. Output of each task is available to the next. Best for linear workflows.</li>
    <li><strong>Hierarchical:</strong> A manager agent delegates tasks to team members. Best for complex projects needing coordination.</li>
</ul>
