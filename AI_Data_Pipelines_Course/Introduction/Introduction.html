<h1>AI-Powered Data Pipeline Orchestration and Anomaly Detection</h1>

<h2>Course Overview</h2>
<p>Welcome to <strong>AI-Powered Data Pipeline Orchestration and Anomaly Detection</strong>. In today's data-driven enterprise landscape, organizations process massive volumes of data through complex pipelines that extract, transform, and load information from diverse sources. Traditional rule-based monitoring approaches struggle to detect subtle data quality issues, schema drift, and anomalous patterns that can compromise downstream analytics and machine learning models.</p>

<p>This comprehensive course equips data engineers, ML engineers, and data platform architects with the knowledge and practical skills to leverage artificial intelligence for building intelligent, self-monitoring, and self-healing data pipelines. You will learn how to integrate machine learning models, large language models (LLMs), and statistical techniques into your data infrastructure to automatically detect anomalies, validate data quality, and orchestrate remediation workflows.</p>

<h2>Purpose and Relevance</h2>
<p>As organizations scale their data operations, manual monitoring and rule-based validation become insufficient. AI-powered data pipelines offer:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Proactive Issue Detection:</strong> Identify data quality problems before they impact business decisions</li>
<li><strong>Reduced Operational Overhead:</strong> Automate monitoring tasks that traditionally require manual intervention</li>
<li><strong>Improved Data Reliability:</strong> Ensure consistent, high-quality data flows to analytics and ML systems</li>
<li><strong>Faster Root Cause Analysis:</strong> Use AI to explain anomalies and suggest remediation strategies</li>
<li><strong>Adaptive Monitoring:</strong> Systems that learn normal patterns and adapt to changing data characteristics</li>
</ul>

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
<p>By the end of this course, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implement AI-powered data quality monitoring systems using statistical and machine learning techniques</li>
<li>Design and deploy automated schema drift detection mechanisms</li>
<li>Build anomaly detection models using Isolation Forest, autoencoders, and statistical methods</li>
<li>Integrate large language models (LLMs) for root cause analysis and data validation</li>
<li>Develop automated remediation workflows for common data pipeline failures</li>
<li>Orchestrate AI-enhanced data pipelines using tools like Airflow, dbt, and Great Expectations</li>
<li>Design comprehensive monitoring dashboards with actionable metrics</li>
<li>Evaluate trade-offs between different AI approaches for data pipeline monitoring</li>
</ul>

<h2>Expected Learner Outcomes</h2>
