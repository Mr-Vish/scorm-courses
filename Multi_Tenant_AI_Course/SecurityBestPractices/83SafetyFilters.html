<h1>8.3 Safety Filters and Content Moderation</h1>

<p>In a multi-tenant system, you are responsible for the content generated by your platform. Implementing robust safety filters is essential for protecting your brand, staying compliant with terms of service, and preventing the generation of harmful or illegal content.</p>

<h2>Types of Safety Filters</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Input Filters:</strong> Checking user prompts for prohibited topics (e.g., hate speech, violence, or instructions for illegal acts) *before* they are sent to the model.</li>
    <li><strong>Output Filters:</strong> Checking the model's generated response for the same categories of harmful content.</li>
    <li><strong>Model-based Moderation:</strong> Using a specialized model (like OpenAI's moderation API or Llama Guard) to classify content into various safety categories.</li>
    <li><strong>Keyword Blacklists:</strong> A simple but often brittle way to block specific words or phrases.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Configuring Tenant-specific Safety</h2>
<p>Different tenants may have different requirements for safety and moderation.
<ul>
    <li><strong>Customizable Thresholds:</strong> Allowing an Enterprise tenant to set more restrictive safety filters than a creative writer using the platform.</li>
    <li><strong>Opt-in/Opt-out Categories:</strong> Letting tenants choose which categories of content they want to filter (e.g., a medical tenant might need to allow discussions of disease and injury that a general business tenant would want to block).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Handling Filter Violations</h2>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Block and Alert:</strong> Refusing to process the request and informing the user that their input violated the safety policy.</li>
    <li><strong>Soft Refusal:</strong> Asking the model to provide a polite refusal: "I'm sorry, I cannot fulfill that request because it violates my safety guidelines."</li>
    <li><strong>Administrative Reporting:</strong> Logging filter violations for the tenant's administrator so they can identify and address problematic users within their organization.</li>
</ol>

<p>By implementing a multi-layered safety strategy, you can ensure that your multi-tenant AI platform remains a safe and productive environment for all your users.</p>
