<h1>Multi-Tenant AI Systems: Design and Architecture</h1>

<div class="intro-section">
<p>Welcome to the comprehensive course on <strong>Multi-Tenant AI Systems: Design and Architecture</strong>. In the rapidly evolving landscape of Artificial Intelligence, the ability to serve multiple customers (tenants) from a single, shared infrastructure is not just a technical challenge—it's a business necessity for any scalable AI-powered SaaS (Software as a Service) platform.</p>

<p>This course is designed for software architects, developers, and product managers who want to understand the unique complexities of building AI applications that are secure, scalable, and cost-effective for a diverse range of customers.</p>

<h2>Why Multi-tenancy Matters for AI</h2>
<p>Traditional SaaS multi-tenancy focuses on isolating databases and web servers. In AI, we must extend these principles to include large language models (LLMs), vector databases, and complex GPU-intensive inference pipelines. Effective multi-tenancy allows you to:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Maximize Resource Utilization:</strong> Share expensive GPU resources across multiple low-volume tenants while still meeting the needs of high-volume clients.</li>
    <li><strong>Reduce Operational Overhead:</strong> Manage a single set of models and code rather than maintaining separate environments for every customer.</li>
    <li><strong>Accelerate Innovation:</strong> Deploy updates and new features to all your customers simultaneously.</li>
    <li><strong>Ensure Strict Data Privacy:</strong> Build trust with your customers by guaranteeing that their sensitive data—and the models fine-tuned on it—stay completely isolated.</li>
</ul></p>

<h2>Course Roadmap</h2>
<p>Throughout this course, we will dive deep into every aspect of the multi-tenant AI lifecycle:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Module 1: Fundamentals:</strong> Basic concepts of isolation, quotas, and billing.</li>
    <li><strong>Module 2: Data Isolation &amp; Security:</strong> Strategies for Silo, Bridge, and Pool models.</li>
    <li><strong>Module 3: Tenant Customization:</strong> Using LoRA adapters and dynamic RAG for personalized AI.</li>
    <li><strong>Module 4: Scalable Infrastructure:</strong> Orchestrating GPUs, K8s, and AI gateways.</li>
    <li><strong>Module 5: Monitoring &amp; Billing:</strong> Usage tracking, cost attribution, and profitability.</li>
    <li><strong>Module 6: Compliance &amp; Governance:</strong> Data residency, GDPR, and model lineage.</li>
    <li><strong>Module 7: Advanced Topics:</strong> Handling noisy neighbors and orchestrating multi-tenant agents.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Course Structure</h2>
<p>This course consists of <strong>7 comprehensive modules</strong> containing over <strong>15 detailed content pages</strong>, multiple hands-on exercises, and a final assessment to validate your expertise. To successfully complete the course, you must score 70% or higher on all assessments.</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>Use the <strong>Next</strong> and <strong>Previous</strong> buttons to navigate. We recommend proceeding in order, as each module builds upon the concepts introduced in the previous ones. Your progress will be saved automatically, allowing you to learn at your own pace.</p>

<p>Let's begin our journey into the world of Multi-Tenant AI Architecture!</p>
