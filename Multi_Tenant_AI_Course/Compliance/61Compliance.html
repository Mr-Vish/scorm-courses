<h1>Module 6: Compliance, Data Residency, and Governance</h1>

<p>Operating a multi-tenant AI system involves navigating a complex web of legal and regulatory requirements. This is especially true when handling sensitive data across different jurisdictions.</p>

<h2>6.1 Data Residency and Sovereignty</h2>
<p>Many countries and regions have strict laws about where data can be stored and processed.
<ul>
    <li><strong>GDPR (EU):</strong> Often requires that personal data of EU citizens stays within the EEA.</li>
    <li><strong>CCPA (California):</strong> Provides residents with rights over their personal data.</li>
    <li><strong>Industry-specific:</strong> HIPAA (Healthcare) and FINRA (Finance) have their own strict data residency and security requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p>In a multi-tenant system, this often means you must be able to pin a specific tenant's data and processing to a specific geographic region.</p>

<h2>6.2 The "Right to be Forgotten" in AI</h2>
<p>Under regulations like GDPR, users have the right to request the deletion of their personal data. In an AI context, this is challenging:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Deleting from Databases:</strong> Easy for traditional records.</li>
    <li><strong>Deleting from Vector Stores:</strong> Requires identifying and removing all vectors associated with that user/tenant.</li>
    <li><strong>Deleting from Models:</strong> Extremely difficult if the data was used for fine-tuning. This is why many multi-tenant providers avoid full fine-tuning on tenant data and prefer RAG or LoRA adapters which can be easily deleted.</li>
</ul></p>

<h2>6.3 Model Governance and Transparency</h2>
<p>Tenants, especially in regulated industries, need to know how the models they are using work and what data they were trained on.
<ul>
    <li><strong>Model Lineage:</strong> Tracking which version of which base model is being used.</li>
    <li><strong>Explainability:</strong> Providing tools to help tenants understand why a model gave a specific answer.</li>
    <li><strong>Audit Logs:</strong> Maintaining a complete, immutable record of every interaction for compliance audits.</li>
</ul></p>

<h2>6.4 Intellectual Property (IP) Considerations</h2>
<p>Who owns the outputs of the AI? Who owns the tenant-specific customizations?
<ul>
    <li><strong>Output Ownership:</strong> Most providers grant ownership of the outputs to the tenant, but this must be clearly defined in the Terms of Service.</li>
    <li><strong>Derivative Works:</strong> If you fine-tune a model on a tenant's data, who owns the resulting weights? Typically, the tenant owns their data, and the provider owns the model, but the tenant has an exclusive right to use that specific fine-tuned version.</li>
</ul></p>

<h2>6.5 Safe Harbor and Liability</h2>
<p>As a multi-tenant provider, you may be held liable for the content generated by your models if it is harmful, illegal, or infringes on copyrights. Implementing robust safety filters and content moderation is not just a moral obligation but a legal necessity.</p>

<p>By staying ahead of the regulatory curve and building compliance into the core of your architecture, you can build trust with your tenants and avoid costly legal issues.</p>
