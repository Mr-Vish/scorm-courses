<h1>Collaboration and Sharing</h1>

<h2>Collaborative Research with NotebookLM</h2>
<p>NotebookLM supports team-based research through its sharing and collaboration features. Multiple users can work with the same sources, ask their own questions, and build collective knowledge while maintaining individual conversation threads.</p>

<h2>Sharing Notebooks</h2>

<h3>How Notebook Sharing Works</h3>
<p>When you share a notebook, collaborators gain access to:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>All uploaded sources:</strong> The complete set of documents in the notebook</li>
    <li><strong>Shared notes:</strong> Notes created by any team member</li>
    <li><strong>Audio overviews:</strong> Generated audio content</li>
    <li><strong>Their own chat history:</strong> Each user maintains separate conversations with the AI</li>
</ul>

<h3>Sharing a Notebook</h3>
<blockquote>
1. Open the notebook you want to share
2. Click the "Share" button (typically in the top-right corner)
3. Enter email addresses of collaborators
4. Choose permission level:
   - Viewer: Can read sources and chat, cannot add/remove sources
   - Editor: Can add/remove sources, create notes, full access
5. Click "Send" to invite collaborators
6. Collaborators receive an email invitation with access link

Note: Collaborators must have Google accounts to access shared notebooks.
</blockquote>

<h2>Permission Levels and Access Control</h2>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Permission</th>
        <th>View Sources</th>
        <th>Chat with AI</th>
        <th>Add/Remove Sources</th>
        <th>Create Notes</th>
        <th>Share with Others</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="rowheader">Owner</td>
        <td>✓</td>
        <td>✓</td>
        <td>✓</td>
        <td>✓</td>
        <td>✓</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="rowheader">Editor</td>
        <td>✓</td>
        <td>✓</td>
        <td>✓</td>
        <td>✓</td>
        <td>✗</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="rowheader">Viewer</td>
        <td>✓</td>
        <td>✓</td>
        <td>✗</td>
        <td>✗</td>
        <td>✗</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h2>Collaborative Workflows</h2>

<h3>Research Team Workflow</h3>
<blockquote>
1. Team Lead creates notebook and uploads initial sources
2. Team Lead shares notebook with team members as Editors
3. Team members add additional relevant sources
4. Each member explores sources through their own queries
5. Members save important insights as shared notes
6. Team Lead generates audio overview for team onboarding
7. Team discusses findings in meetings, referencing notebook
8. Final synthesis created collaboratively using shared notes
</blockquote>

<h3>Student Study Group Workflow</h3>
<blockquote>
1. One student creates notebook with course materials
2. Shares with study group members as Editors
3. Each student asks questions relevant to their understanding gaps
4. Group generates practice questions using NotebookLM
5. Students create shared notes with key concepts
6. Audio overviews generated for exam review
7. Group meets to discuss and clarify concepts
</blockquote>

<h3>Business Intelligence Workflow</h3>
<blockquote>
1. Analyst creates notebook with market research reports
2. Shares with stakeholders as Viewers
3. Analyst generates executive summary and audio overview
4. Stakeholders review and ask clarifying questions
5. Analyst creates additional focused summaries based on feedback
6. Final insights compiled into shared notes
7. Presentation materials developed from notebook content
</blockquote>

<h2>Privacy and Conversation Isolation</h2>
<p>An important feature of NotebookLM collaboration is <strong>conversation privacy</strong>:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Private Chats:</strong> Your conversations with the AI are private to you</li>
    <li><strong>Shared Sources:</strong> All collaborators see the same sources</li>
    <li><strong>Shared Notes:</strong> Notes are visible to all collaborators</li>
    <li><strong>Independent Exploration:</strong> Each user can explore sources without affecting others' experience</li>
</ul>

<p>This design allows team members to ask "basic" questions without embarrassment and explore topics at their own pace.</p>

<h2>Managing Shared Notebooks</h2>

<h3>Viewing Collaborators</h3>
<blockquote>
1. Open the shared notebook
2. Click "Share" or the collaborators icon
3. View list of current collaborators and their permission levels
4. Modify permissions or remove access as needed (Owner only)
</blockquote>

<h3>Leaving a Shared Notebook</h3>
<blockquote>
1. Open the notebook
2. Click your profile or settings
3. Select "Leave notebook"
4. Confirm - you'll lose access but can be re-invited

Note: Owners cannot leave; they must transfer ownership first.
</blockquote>

<h3>Transferring Ownership</h3>
<blockquote>
1. Open notebook settings
2. Select "Transfer ownership"
3. Choose new owner from current collaborators
4. Confirm transfer
5. You become an Editor after transfer completes
</blockquote>

<h2>Best Practices for Collaboration</h2>

<h3>1. Establish Clear Roles</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Designate who can add/remove sources</li>
    <li>Assign responsibility for note organization</li>
    <li>Clarify who generates audio overviews</li>
    <li>Define decision-making authority for the notebook</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Use Naming Conventions</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Name sources consistently (e.g., "AuthorYear_Topic")</li>
    <li>Use descriptive note titles</li>
    <li>Include dates in version-controlled documents</li>
    <li>Tag or prefix notes by contributor if helpful</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Communicate Outside NotebookLM</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Use team chat or email to coordinate source additions</li>
    <li>Schedule meetings to discuss findings</li>
    <li>Share important insights via notes, not just private chats</li>
    <li>Document decisions and action items externally</li>
</ul>

<h3>4. Manage Source Bloat</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Regularly review and remove outdated sources</li>
    <li>Avoid duplicate uploads</li>
    <li>Consolidate related documents when possible</li>
    <li>Stay within the 50-source limit strategically</li>
</ul>

<h2>Sharing Individual Content</h2>

<h3>Sharing Audio Overviews</h3>
<p>Audio overviews can be shared independently of the notebook:</p>

<blockquote>
1. Generate audio overview
2. Click "Share" on the audio player
3. Options:
   - Copy shareable link (requires notebook access)
   - Download MP3 file to share externally
   - Embed in presentations or websites
</blockquote>

<h3>Sharing Notes and Insights</h3>
<blockquote>
1. Open the note you want to share
2. Click "Export" or copy icon
3. Options:
   - Copy to clipboard for pasting elsewhere
   - Export as document
   - Share link (requires notebook access)
</blockquote>

<h3>Sharing Specific Responses</h3>
<blockquote>
1. Find the AI response you want to share
2. Click the share or copy icon
3. Copy text with citations
4. Paste into email, document, or presentation
5. Citations remain as text references
</blockquote>

<h2>Collaboration Limitations</h2>
<p>Be aware of these constraints when collaborating:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>No Real-Time Editing:</strong> Unlike Google Docs, you can't see others' actions in real-time</li>
    <li><strong>No Chat Sharing:</strong> Cannot view others' conversation histories</li>
    <li><strong>No Comments:</strong> Cannot comment on sources or notes directly</li>
    <li><strong>Limited Notifications:</strong> No alerts when collaborators add sources or notes</li>
    <li><strong>No Version History:</strong> Cannot track changes to sources or notes over time</li>
</ul>

<h2>Security and Confidentiality</h2>

<h3>Data Privacy in Shared Notebooks</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Only invited collaborators can access the notebook</li>
    <li>Google does not use shared notebook content for AI training</li>
    <li>Conversations remain private to each user</li>
    <li>Shared notes are visible to all collaborators</li>
</ul>

<h3>Best Practices for Sensitive Information</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Only share notebooks with trusted collaborators</li>
    <li>Use Viewer permissions for stakeholders who don't need editing rights</li>
    <li>Avoid uploading highly confidential documents to shared notebooks</li>
    <li>Remove collaborators promptly when they leave the project</li>
    <li>Consider separate notebooks for different sensitivity levels</li>
</ul>

<h2>Use Cases for Collaboration</h2>

<h3>Academic Research Teams</h3>
<p>Multiple researchers analyzing literature for a joint publication, each exploring different aspects while building shared understanding.</p>

<h3>Corporate Strategy Teams</h3>
<p>Business analysts sharing market research, competitive intelligence, and industry reports to inform strategic decisions.</p>

<h3>Legal Case Preparation</h3>
<p>Legal teams analyzing case documents, precedents, and evidence with controlled access for different team members.</p>
