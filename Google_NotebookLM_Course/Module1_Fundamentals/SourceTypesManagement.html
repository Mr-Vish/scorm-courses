<h2>Source Size and Quantity Limits</h2>
<p>Understanding NotebookLM's capacity constraints helps you plan your research projects effectively:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Maximum Sources per Notebook:</strong> 50 sources</li>
    <li><strong>Maximum Words per Source:</strong> 500,000 words (approximately 1,000 pages)</li>
    <li><strong>Total Notebook Capacity:</strong> Up to 25 million words across all sources</li>
    <li><strong>File Size Limits:</strong> Varies by type, typically up to 500MB for PDFs</li>
</ul>

<h2>Adding Sources to Your Notebook</h2>

<h3>Method 1: Google Drive Integration</h3>
<blockquote>
1. Click "Add Source" or the "+" button in your notebook
2. Select "Google Drive"
3. Navigate to your document (Docs, Slides, or Sheets)
4. Click "Select" to add the source
5. NotebookLM will process and index the document

Note: Google Drive sources maintain a live connection and can be refreshed to reflect updates.
</blockquote>

<h3>Method 2: File Upload</h3>
<blockquote>
1. Click "Add Source" or the "+" button
2. Select "Upload" or drag and drop files
3. Choose PDF, TXT, MD, or audio files from your computer
4. Wait for processing to complete (typically 10-60 seconds)
5. The source appears in your sources list

Tip: You can upload multiple files simultaneously by selecting them together.
</blockquote>

<h3>Method 3: Web URL</h3>
<blockquote>
1. Click "Add Source"
2. Select "Website URL"
3. Paste the complete URL of the web page
4. Click "Add" or press Enter
5. NotebookLM fetches and processes the content

Important: Only publicly accessible URLs work. Password-protected or paywalled content cannot be added.
</blockquote>

<h3>Method 4: YouTube Video</h3>
<blockquote>
1. Click "Add Source"
2. Select "YouTube URL"
3. Paste the YouTube video link
4. NotebookLM extracts available transcripts/captions
5. The transcript becomes searchable and analyzable

Note: Videos without captions or transcripts cannot be processed.
</blockquote>

<h2>Source Management Best Practices</h2>

<h3>Organizing Sources</h3>
<p>While NotebookLM doesn't have folder structures, you can organize sources effectively:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Naming Conventions:</strong> Rename sources with descriptive titles (e.g., "Smith2023_ClimateStudy" instead of "document.pdf")</li>
    <li><strong>Chronological Ordering:</strong> Add sources in logical sequence for your research flow</li>
    <li><strong>Thematic Grouping:</strong> Create separate notebooks for distinct topics or projects</li>
    <li><strong>Version Control:</strong> Include version numbers or dates in source names when tracking document revisions</li>
</ul>

<h3>Source Selection Strategy</h3>
<p>Not all documents are equally valuable for NotebookLM analysis. Prioritize sources that:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Contain Substantive Text:</strong> Documents with meaningful content, not just images or tables</li>
    <li><strong>Are Well-Structured:</strong> Clear headings, paragraphs, and logical organization improve AI understanding</li>
    <li><strong>Complement Each Other:</strong> Sources that provide different perspectives or cover related aspects</li>
    <li><strong>Are Authoritative:</strong> Reliable, credible sources produce more trustworthy insights</li>
</ul>

<h2>Updating and Refreshing Sources</h2>

<h3>Google Drive Sources</h3>
<p>Documents connected from Google Drive can be refreshed to reflect changes:</p>

<blockquote>
1. Locate the source in your notebook's source list
2. Click the refresh icon next to the source name
3. NotebookLM re-processes the updated content
4. Previous chat history remains, but new queries reflect updated content

Use Case: Collaborative documents that team members are actively editing.
</blockquote>

<h3>Static Sources (PDFs, URLs)</h3>
<p>Uploaded files and web URLs are static snapshots. To update:</p>

<blockquote>
1. Remove the old version of the source
2. Upload or add the new version
3. Previous conversations referencing the old source remain but may become outdated

Best Practice: Include version numbers in source names to track which version conversations reference.
</blockquote>

<h2>Removing Sources</h2>
<p>When a source is no longer needed or was added by mistake:</p>

<blockquote>
1. Hover over the source in your sources list
2. Click the three-dot menu (⋮)
3. Select "Remove source"
4. Confirm the removal

Warning: Removing a source doesn't delete chat history, but responses that cited that source may no longer be verifiable.
</blockquote>

<h2>Source Processing and Indexing</h2>
<p>Understanding what happens during source processing helps you anticipate capabilities and limitations:</p>

<h3>Text Extraction</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Plain Text:</strong> Directly indexed and searchable</li>
    <li><strong>PDFs:</strong> Text extracted via OCR if needed; formatting preserved where possible</li>
    <li><strong>Web Pages:</strong> Main content extracted; ads and navigation typically excluded</li>
    <li><strong>Presentations:</strong> Slide text and speaker notes extracted; images described if text is present</li>
</ul>

<h3>Semantic Indexing</h3>
<p>NotebookLM creates semantic embeddings that capture meaning, not just keywords. This enables:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Conceptual searches that find relevant passages even without exact keyword matches</li>
    <li>Cross-source connections based on related ideas</li>
    <li>Context-aware responses that understand nuance and implication</li>
</ul>

<h2>Working with Large Document Collections</h2>
<p>When working with many sources, consider these strategies:</p>

<h3>Selective Source Inclusion</h3>
<p>Instead of uploading everything, curate sources strategically:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Start with 5-10 core sources</li>
    <li>Add supplementary sources as specific questions arise</li>
    <li>Remove sources that prove less relevant</li>
</ul>

<h3>Multiple Notebooks Approach</h3>
<p>For complex projects, create multiple notebooks:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Primary Research Notebook:</strong> Core sources and main analysis</li>
    <li><strong>Background Reading Notebook:</strong> Contextual and foundational materials</li>
    <li><strong>Methodology Notebook:</strong> Research methods and technical documentation</li>
    <li><strong>Synthesis Notebook:</strong> Generated notes and insights from other notebooks</li>
</ul>

<h2>Source Quality and AI Performance</h2>
<p>The quality of your sources directly impacts NotebookLM's effectiveness:</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Source Quality Factor</th>
        <th>Impact on AI Performance</th>
        <th>Recommendation</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="rowheader">Text Clarity</td>
        <td>Clear text improves comprehension and citation accuracy</td>
        <td>Use high-quality PDFs; avoid heavily scanned or low-resolution documents</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="rowheader">Structure</td>
        <td>Well-organized documents enable better section-specific queries</td>
        <td>Prefer sources with clear headings, sections, and logical flow</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="rowheader">Relevance</td>
        <td>Irrelevant sources dilute focus and may introduce noise</td>
        <td>Be selective; quality over quantity</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="rowheader">Consistency</td>
        <td>Contradictory sources require explicit handling in prompts</td>
        <td>Acknowledge conflicts; ask NotebookLM to compare perspectives</td>
    </tr>
