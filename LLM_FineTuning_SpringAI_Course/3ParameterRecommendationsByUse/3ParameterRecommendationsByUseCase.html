<h1>3. Pros, Cons, and Use Cases</h1>

<p>Fine-tuning is a powerful tool, but it&#x27;s not always the right solution. Understanding when to use it versus other techniques like RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is key to building efficient AI systems.</p>

<h3>Advantages of Fine-Tuning</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Unmatched Specialization:</strong> The model deeply learns the nuances of your specific task.</li>
    <li><strong>Reduced Token Usage:</strong> You don&#x27;t need to provide long instructions or many examples in every prompt.</li>
    <li><strong>Privacy:</strong> You can fine-tune small models locally to keep sensitive data within your infrastructure.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Limitations and Risks</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Data Dependency:</strong> Requires high-quality labeled data. Poor data leads to poor performance.</li>
    <li><strong>Static Knowledge:</strong> Once fine-tuned, the model&#x27;s knowledge is frozen until the next training run.</li>
    <li><strong>Catastrophic Forgetting:</strong> The model might lose general reasoning capabilities or become &quot;overfitted&quot; to the training data.</li>
    <li><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Fine-tuned models need to be updated as the underlying base models evolve.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ethical Considerations</h3>
<p>Fine-tuning can inadvertently amplify biases present in your training data. Always audit your datasets for fairness and representativeness before training.</p>
