<h1>LLM Fine-Tuning in Spring AI - Summary</h1>

<p>In this introduction, we covered the fundamental definition of fine-tuning as a process of adapting pre-trained models to specific tasks by updating their weights. We explored the advantages of fine-tuning over prompt engineering, including improved domain expertise and format adherence. Finally, we saw how Spring AI fits into the model lifecycle by providing a unified interface to call these specialized models.</p>

<p>Review these concepts before proceeding to the first assessment.</p>
