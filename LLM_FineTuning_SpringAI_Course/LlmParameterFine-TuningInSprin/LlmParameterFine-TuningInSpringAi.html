<h1>Introduction to LLM Fine-Tuning in Spring AI</h1>

<p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are incredibly versatile, but sometimes &quot;out-of-the-box&quot; performance isn&#x27;t enough for specialized domains or specific stylistic requirements. This is where <strong>Fine-Tuning</strong> comes in.</p>

<h3>What is LLM Fine-Tuning?</h3>
<p>Fine-tuning is the process of taking a pre-trained model (like Llama 3 or GPT-4) and further training it on a smaller, targeted dataset. Unlike prompt engineering, which guides the model&#x27;s behavior through input text, fine-tuning actually modifies the model&#x27;s internal weights to better align with your specific needs.</p>

<h3>Why Fine-Tune Beyond Prompt Engineering?</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Domain Expertise:</strong> Teach the model specialized terminology and knowledge not present in its original training data.</li>
    <li><strong>Style and Tone:</strong> Ensure the model consistently matches your brand&#x27;s voice or a specific persona.</li>
    <li><strong>Format Adherence:</strong> Improve the model&#x27;s ability to follow complex output structures (like specific JSON schemas) without lengthy instructions.</li>
    <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Achieve higher performance with smaller, faster, and cheaper models that have been tuned for a specific task.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Spring AI and the Fine-Tuning Lifecycle</h3>
<p>Spring AI provides a robust framework for integrating fine-tuned models into your Java applications. While the actual training often happens in specialized environments, Spring AI excels at <strong>Model Orchestration</strong>—allowing you to easily swap between base models and your custom fine-tuned versions using the <code>ChatOptions</code> interface and portable API.</p>

<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
<p>By the end of this course, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Explain the fundamental concepts and objectives of LLM fine-tuning.</li>
    <li>Identify when to use fine-tuning versus prompt engineering or RAG.</li>
    <li>Understand Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques like LoRA.</li>
    <li>Implement Spring AI configurations to utilize fine-tuned models effectively.</li>
    <li>Evaluate the success of a fine-tuned model using standard metrics.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Target Audience:</strong> Java developers familiar with Spring Boot who want to take their AI-powered applications to the next level of precision and specialization.</p>
