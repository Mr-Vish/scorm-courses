<h1>1. Fine-Tuning Fundamentals: Evaluation</h1>

<p>How do you know if your fine-tuned model is actually better than the base model? Evaluation is critical to prevent &quot;catastrophic forgetting&quot;—where the model gains new skills but loses its general reasoning abilities.</p>

<h3>Key Evaluation Metrics</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Perplexity:</strong> A mathematical measure of how well the model predicts a sample. Lower perplexity generally indicates a better fit to the data, but it doesn&#x27;t always correlate with human-perceived quality.</li>
    <li><strong>BLEU and ROUGE Scores:</strong> Common metrics for translation and summarization that compare the model&#x27;s output to a reference text based on overlapping words (n-grams).</li>
    <li><strong>Task-Specific Metrics:</strong> For a coding model, this might be &quot;Pass@k&quot; (the probability that at least one of top k generated code samples passes unit tests).</li>
</ul>

<h3>The &quot;Golden Dataset&quot; Approach</h3>
<p>The best way to evaluate a fine-tuned model is to create a <strong>Golden Dataset</strong>: a set of high-priority prompts and their &quot;perfect&quot; answers that were <em>not</em> included in the training set. Compare the base model&#x27;s performance against your fine-tuned model on this dataset using:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>LLM-as-a-Judge:</strong> Use a larger, more capable model (like GPT-4) to grade the outputs of your smaller fine-tuned model.</li>
    <li><strong>Human Review:</strong> The gold standard. Have experts rank the responses for accuracy, tone, and helpfulness.</li>
</ul>
