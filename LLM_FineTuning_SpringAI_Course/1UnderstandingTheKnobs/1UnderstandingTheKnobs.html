<h1>1. Fine-Tuning Fundamentals: Datasets and Objectives</h1>

<p>Before you begin the fine-tuning process, you must understand the foundational components: the data you use and the objectives you set.</p>

<h3>The Power of the Dataset</h3>
<p>In fine-tuning, the quality of your dataset is far more important than its size. A few hundred high-quality, diverse, and representative examples often outperform thousands of noisy or repetitive ones.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Diversity:</strong> Ensure your dataset covers all the scenarios you want the model to handle.</li>
    <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> The &quot;correct&quot; answers in your dataset should follow a consistent style and format.</li>
    <li><strong>Cleaning:</strong> Remove duplicates, fix typos, and ensure the data is properly formatted (usually in JSONL format for most providers).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Fine-Tuning Objectives</h3>
<p>There are different ways to guide a model&#x27;s learning during fine-tuning:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT):</strong> The most common method. You provide pairs of &quot;Prompt&quot; and &quot;Target Response.&quot; The model learns to predict the next token by minimizing the difference between its output and the target response.</li>
    <li><strong>Instruction Tuning:</strong> A subset of SFT where the data is specifically formatted as instructions (e.g., &quot;Summarize this text: [text]&quot;). This helps the model become a better assistant.</li>
    <li><strong>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF):</strong> A more advanced technique where the model is tuned based on a reward system, often using human rankings of different model outputs to align it with human preferences and safety guidelines.</li>
</ul>
