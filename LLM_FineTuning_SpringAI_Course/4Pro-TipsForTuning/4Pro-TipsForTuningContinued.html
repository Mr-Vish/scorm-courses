<h1>4. Pro-Tips for Fine-Tuning</h1>

<p>Here are some practical tips from the field to help you avoid common pitfalls:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Start with Prompt Engineering:</strong> Never fine-tune before you&#x27;ve exhausted the possibilities of prompt engineering and RAG. Prompt engineering is the best way to prototype your dataset.</li>
    <li><strong>The &quot;Rule of 100&quot;:</strong> Start with at least 100 high-quality examples. If you don&#x27;t see improvement, focus on data quality before increasing the quantity.</li>
    <li><strong>Monitor Validation Loss:</strong> If your training loss keeps going down but validation loss starts going up, you are <strong>overfitting</strong>. Stop training early!</li>
    <li><strong>Use Spring AI Adviors:</strong> Implement custom <code>RequestResponseAdvisor</code> in Spring AI to log exactly which model version was used and the parameters for every request. This is invaluable for debugging production issues.</li>
    <li><strong>Small Models for specialized tasks:</strong> Often, a fine-tuned 8B model will outperform a general-purpose 70B model on a specific, narrow task, while being much cheaper and faster to run.</li>
</ul>
