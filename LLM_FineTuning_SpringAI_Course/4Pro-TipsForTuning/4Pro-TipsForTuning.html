<h1>4. Fine-Tuning Workflows</h1>

<p>A successful fine-tuning project follows a structured lifecycle. Understanding this flow helps you plan resources and manage expectations.</p>

<h3>The Fine-Tuning Lifecycle</h3>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Data Preparation:</strong> Identify use cases and collect high-quality examples. Clean and format them into JSONL.</li>
    <li><strong>Base Model Selection:</strong> Choose a base model that is &quot;close enough&quot; to your target task. Small models (7B-8B parameters) are often excellent candidates for fine-tuning.</li>
    <li><strong>Hyperparameter Tuning:</strong> Set your learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs. For PEFT/LoRA, you&#x27;ll also set the &quot;rank&quot; (r).</li>
    <li><strong>Training:</strong> Run the fine-tuning job. Monitor &quot;Training Loss&quot; and &quot;Validation Loss&quot; to ensure the model is learning without overfitting.</li>
    <li><strong>Evaluation:</strong> Test against your Golden Dataset. Use Spring AI to easily swap between the base model and the new fine-tuned model for side-by-side comparison.</li>
    <li><strong>Deployment &amp; Monitoring:</strong> Deploy the model and monitor its performance in production. Watch for &quot;drift&quot; as your real-world data changes over time.</li>
</ol>
