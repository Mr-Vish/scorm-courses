<ul>
    <li>Understand major AI governance frameworks (NIST AI RMF, EU AI Act, ISO 42001)</li>
    <li>Develop comprehensive AI policies including acceptable use and data handling</li>
    <li>Define governance roles and responsibilities using RACI models</li>
    <li>Conduct AI risk assessments and classify systems by risk tier</li>
    <li>Implement technical controls for input validation, output filtering, and monitoring</li>
    <li>Create model cards and maintain comprehensive AI documentation</li>
    <li>Execute AI audits covering bias, security, and compliance</li>
    <li>Navigate regulatory requirements (GDPR, EU AI Act, sector-specific regulations)</li>
