<h1>AI Policies and Acceptable Use</h1>

<h2>Core Policy Framework</h2>
<p>Effective AI governance requires multiple interconnected policies that guide behavior, set boundaries, and define processes:</p>

<table>
    <tr><th>Policy Type</th><th>Purpose</th><th>Audience</th><th>Update Frequency</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Acceptable Use Policy</td><td>Define approved and prohibited AI uses</td><td>All employees</td><td>Quarterly</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Data Handling Policy</td><td>Rules for data input to AI systems</td><td>All users, developers</td><td>Quarterly</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Model Development Policy</td><td>Standards for building AI systems</td><td>Data scientists, engineers</td><td>Semi-annually</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Deployment Policy</td><td>Requirements before production release</td><td>Product teams, DevOps</td><td>Semi-annually</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Monitoring Policy</td><td>Ongoing oversight requirements</td><td>Operations, compliance</td><td>Annually</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Incident Response Policy</td><td>Process for AI failures or harms</td><td>All stakeholders</td><td>Annually</td></tr>
</table>

<h2>Acceptable Use Policy Template</h2>
<div class="code-block">

## 2. PROHIBITED USES

### Strictly Forbidden
❌ Automated decisions on employment, credit, housing without human review
❌ Generating deepfakes or impersonating real individuals
❌ Processing regulated data (HIPAA, PCI-DSS) in unapproved tools
❌ Bypassing security controls or data loss prevention systems
❌ Creating content that violates laws, regulations, or company values
❌ Using AI outputs as final decisions in high-stakes scenarios

### Requires Special Authorization
⚠️  Biometric data processing (facial recognition, voice analysis)
⚠️  Sentiment analysis of employee communications
⚠️  Predictive analytics on protected characteristics
⚠️  AI systems that interact with minors

## 3. DATA HANDLING REQUIREMENTS

### Input Data Classification
- PUBLIC: No restrictions (e.g., public documentation)
- INTERNAL: Approved AI gateway only (e.g., internal reports)
- CONFIDENTIAL: Approved tools with DLP (e.g., customer data)
- RESTRICTED: Prohibited in AI systems (e.g., trade secrets, PII)

### Specific Prohibitions
- Never input customer PII into public AI services
- Never upload confidential documents to unapproved tools
- Never share API keys or credentials with AI systems
- Never use production data in AI experiments without anonymization

## 4. OUTPUT HANDLING

### Review Requirements
- External publication: Human review + legal clearance
- Customer communication: Human review + tone check
- Code deployment: Standard code review + security scan
- Financial/legal content: Subject matter expert review

### Attribution and Disclosure
- Disclose AI assistance in customer-facing content
- Cite AI-generated code with model and version
- Label AI-generated images and media
- Document AI involvement in decision-making processes

## 5. COMPLIANCE OBLIGATIONS

- Complete AI training before using enterprise AI tools
- Report policy violations to ai-governance@company.com
- Participate in audits and provide requested documentation
- Update use cases in AI inventory within 5 business days</code></pre>

<h2>Data Handling Policy Details</h2>
<p>Data handling is the highest-risk area in GenAI governance. Clear rules prevent data leakage and compliance violations:</p>

<table>
    <tr><th>Data Type</th><th>Public AI Tools</th><th>Enterprise AI Gateway</th><th>Approved Vendors</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Public information</td><td>✓ Allowed</td><td>✓ Allowed</td><td>✓ Allowed</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Internal documents</td><td>✗ Prohibited</td><td>✓ Allowed</td><td>✓ With DPA</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Customer data (non-PII)</td><td>✗ Prohibited</td><td>✓ With logging</td><td>✓ With DPA + audit</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Customer PII</td><td>✗ Prohibited</td><td>✓ With redaction</td><td>✓ With BAA/DPA</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Regulated data (HIPAA/PCI)</td><td>✗ Prohibited</td><td>✗ Prohibited</td><td>✓ Certified vendors only</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Trade secrets</td><td>✗ Prohibited</td><td>✗ Prohibited</td><td>✗ Prohibited</td></tr>
</table>

<h2>Model Development Standards</h2>
<div class="code-block">
<pre><code># AI Model Development Policy - Key Requirements

## Pre-Development
1. Use Case Documentation
   - Business justification and expected benefits
   - Alternative approaches considered
   - Stakeholder identification and impact assessment

2. Risk Assessment
   - Complete AI risk questionnaire
   - Identify potential harms and affected groups
   - Determine risk tier and approval requirements

## Development Phase
3. Data Requirements
   - Document data sources and collection methods
   - Verify data rights and licensing
   - Assess data quality and representativeness
   - Implement bias testing on training data

4. Model Documentation (Model Card)
   - Intended use and out-of-scope uses
   - Training data characteristics
   - Performance metrics across demographic groups
   - Known limitations and failure modes

5. Testing Requirements
   - Accuracy testing on diverse test sets
   - Bias and fairness evaluation
   - Adversarial testing (prompt injection, jailbreaks)
   - Performance under edge cases

## Pre-Deployment
6. Security Review
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - Output filtering and content moderation
   - Rate limiting and abuse prevention
   - Logging and monitoring implementation

7. Approval Gates

<h2>Incident Response Process</h2>
<div class="code-block">
<pre><code># AI Incident Response Workflow

## Severity Classification
- P0 (Critical): Active harm, data breach, regulatory violation
- P1 (High): Significant accuracy degradation, bias detected
- P2 (Medium): Performance issues, user complaints
- P3 (Low): Minor bugs, documentation gaps

## Response Steps
1. DETECT: Automated alerts or user reports
2. TRIAGE: Assess severity and impact (15 min for P0)
3. CONTAIN: Disable system or limit scope (30 min for P0)
4. INVESTIGATE: Root cause analysis
5. REMEDIATE: Fix issue and test solution
6. COMMUNICATE: Notify stakeholders and affected users
7. DOCUMENT: Incident report and lessons learned
8. IMPROVE: Update policies, controls, or training

## Escalation Path
- P3: Team lead → Product manager
- P2: Product manager → Department head
- P1: Department head → VP Engineering + Legal
- P0: VP Engineering + Legal → CEO + Board (if material)</code></pre>
</div>

<h2>Policy Enforcement</h2>
<p>Policies are only effective if enforced consistently:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Technical Controls:</strong> AI gateway blocks unapproved tools, DLP prevents data leakage</li>
    <li><strong>Monitoring:</strong> Log analysis detects policy violations, usage patterns reviewed quarterly</li>
    <li><strong>Training:</strong> Mandatory AI governance training for all employees, role-specific training for developers</li>
    <li><strong>Audits:</strong> Random sampling of AI use cases, annual comprehensive audit</li>
    <li><strong>Consequences:</strong> First violation: warning and retraining; Repeated violations: access revocation; Intentional violations: disciplinary action</li>
</ul>
