<h2>GDPR and AI</h2>
<p>GDPR applies to AI systems that process personal data. Key considerations:</p>

<table>
    <tr><th>GDPR Principle</th><th>AI Implication</th><th>Compliance Approach</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Lawful Basis</td><td>Must have legal basis for processing (consent, contract, legitimate interest)</td><td>Document lawful basis for training and inference data</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Purpose Limitation</td><td>Data used only for specified purposes</td><td>Separate models for different purposes, no scope creep</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Data Minimization</td><td>Collect only necessary data</td><td>Use synthetic data, federated learning, differential privacy</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Accuracy</td><td>Data must be accurate and up-to-date</td><td>Regular data quality checks, user correction mechanisms</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Storage Limitation</td><td>Retain data only as long as necessary</td><td>Automated deletion, model retraining without old data</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Integrity & Confidentiality</td><td>Secure data processing</td><td>Encryption, access controls, security testing</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Accountability</td><td>Demonstrate compliance</td><td>Documentation, DPIAs, audit trails</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>GDPR Article 22: Automated Decision-Making</h3>
<div class="code-block">
<pre><code># GDPR Article 22 Requirements

Right Not to Be Subject to Automated Decision-Making:
- Individuals have the right not to be subject to decisions based 
  solely on automated processing that produce legal or similarly 
  significant effects

Exceptions (Automated Decisions Allowed If):
1. Necessary for contract performance
2. Authorized by EU or member state law
3. Based on explicit consent

Additional Safeguards Required:
✓ Right to obtain human intervention
✓ Right to express point of view
✓ Right to contest the decision
✓ Right to obtain an explanation

Implementation for AI Systems:
- Classify decisions by significance (legal, financial, etc.)
- Implement human-in-the-loop for significant decisions
- Provide explanation mechanisms (SHAP, LIME, etc.)
- Document decision logic and factors
- Enable appeals process</code></pre>

<h2>Sector-Specific Regulations</h2>

<h3>Healthcare: HIPAA and FDA</h3>
<table>
    <tr><th>Requirement</th><th>Description</th><th>AI Implications</th></tr>
    <tr><td>HIPAA Privacy Rule</td><td>Protect patient health information</td><td>PHI in training data requires BAA, encryption, access controls</td></tr>
    <tr><td>HIPAA Security Rule</td><td>Administrative, physical, technical safeguards</td><td>Risk assessment, audit controls, integrity controls for AI systems</td></tr>
    <tr><td>FDA Regulation</td><td>Medical devices including AI/ML</td><td>Clinical validation, 510(k) clearance or PMA for diagnostic/treatment AI</td></tr>
    <tr><td>FDA AI/ML Action Plan</td><td>Adaptive AI in medical devices</td><td>Predetermined change control plan, real-world performance monitoring</td></tr>

</table>

<h2>Compliance Mapping Process</h2>
<div class="code-block">
<pre><code># Regulatory Compliance Mapping

Step 1: Identify Applicable Regulations
- Geography: Where is the AI deployed and where are users located?
- Industry: Healthcare, finance, education, etc.
- Data Types: Personal data, health data, financial data, biometric
- Use Case: Employment, credit, law enforcement, etc.

Step 2: Map Requirements to AI System
For each regulation:
- List specific requirements
- Determine applicability to the AI system
- Identify gaps between current state and requirements
- Assess compliance risk (high/medium/low)

Step 3: Develop Compliance Plan
- Prioritize high-risk gaps
- Assign owners and deadlines
- Implement technical and process controls
- Document compliance evidence

Step 4: Ongoing Monitoring
- Track regulatory changes
- Update compliance mapping quarterly
- Conduct compliance audits
- Report to governance board

Example Mapping:
AI System: Customer Credit Scoring
Regulations: ECOA, FCRA, GDPR (if EU customers)

ECOA Requirements:
✓ No discrimination on protected characteristics
✓ Adverse action notices with reasons
✓ Monitoring for disparate impact
Gap: Need to implement explainability for adverse actions
Owner: Model Owner | Due: 60 days | Risk: High

FCRA Requirements:
✓ Accuracy of data
✓ Dispute resolution process
✓ Reasonable procedures to ensure accuracy
Gap: Dispute resolution process not documented
Owner: Compliance Officer | Due: 30 days | Risk: Medium</code></pre>

<h2>Data Processing Agreements (DPAs)</h2>
<p>When using third-party AI services, DPAs are essential for compliance:</p>

<table>
    <tr><th>DPA Clause</th><th>Purpose</th><th>Key Terms</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Data Processing Terms</td><td>Define roles (controller vs processor)</td><td>Scope of processing, data types, purposes</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Security Measures</td><td>Ensure adequate security</td><td>Encryption, access controls, incident response</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Subprocessors</td><td>Control data sharing</td><td>List of subprocessors, approval rights</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Data Subject Rights</td><td>Enable GDPR rights</td><td>Access, deletion, portability mechanisms</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Data Transfers</td><td>Comply with cross-border rules</td><td>Standard contractual clauses, adequacy decisions</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Audit Rights</td><td>Verify compliance</td><td>Right to audit, frequency, scope</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Liability</td><td>Allocate risk</td><td>Indemnification, liability caps</td></tr>
</table>

<h2>Compliance Documentation</h2>
<p>Maintain comprehensive records to demonstrate compliance:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Records of Processing Activities (ROPA):</strong> GDPR Article 30 requires documentation of all processing activities</li>
    <li><strong>Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIA):</strong> Required for high-risk processing under GDPR</li>
    <li><strong>Legitimate Interest Assessments (LIA):</strong> If relying on legitimate interest as lawful basis</li>
    <li><strong>Consent Records:</strong> If relying on consent, maintain records of when and how obtained</li>
    <li><strong>Data Transfer Mechanisms:</strong> Standard contractual clauses, binding corporate rules</li>
    <li><strong>Vendor Assessments:</strong> Due diligence on third-party AI providers</li>
    <li><strong>Training Records:</strong> Evidence of employee training on compliance</li>
    <li><strong>Incident Logs:</strong> Breaches, near-misses, and responses</li>
</ul>

<h2>Preparing for Regulatory Inquiries</h2>
<div class="code-block">
<pre><code># Regulatory Inquiry Response Plan

When Regulator Contacts Organization:
1. Acknowledge receipt within 24 hours
2. Assemble response team (Legal, Compliance, AI Governance, Model Owner)
3. Preserve all relevant documents and data
4. Do not delete or modify AI systems or logs

Information Typically Requested:
- AI system inventory and descriptions
- Risk assessments and approvals
- Model cards and technical documentation
- Training data sources and characteristics
- Bias testing and fairness audits
- Incident reports and remediation
- Policies and procedures
- Training records

Response Timeline:
- Initial response: 5-10 business days
- Full documentation: 30-60 days (varies by regulator)
- Follow-up questions: 10-15 business days

Best Practices:
✓ Maintain organized documentation proactively
✓ Conduct mock regulatory inquiries annually
✓ Designate regulatory liaison
✓ Legal review before submitting responses
✓ Track all communications with regulator</code></pre>
