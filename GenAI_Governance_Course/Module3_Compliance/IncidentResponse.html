<h1>Incident Response and Continuous Improvement</h1>

<h2>AI Incident Types</h2>
<p>AI incidents differ from traditional IT incidents. Organizations need specialized response procedures:</p>

<table>
    <tr><th>Incident Type</th><th>Examples</th><th>Immediate Actions</th><th>Investigation Focus</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Accuracy Failure</td><td>Hallucinations, wrong answers, outdated information</td><td>Assess impact, notify affected users</td><td>Root cause, data drift, model degradation</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Bias Incident</td><td>Discriminatory outputs, disparate impact detected</td><td>Disable system if severe, document cases</td><td>Training data, model behavior, affected groups</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Privacy Breach</td><td>PII leakage, unauthorized data access, training data extraction</td><td>Contain breach, notify DPO, preserve evidence</td><td>Data flow, access logs, breach scope</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Security Compromise</td><td>Prompt injection success, jailbreak, data exfiltration</td><td>Isolate system, block attacker, patch vulnerability</td><td>Attack vector, exploited weakness, blast radius</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Compliance Violation</td><td>Regulatory breach, policy violation, unauthorized use</td><td>Cease violating activity, notify legal</td><td>Violation scope, regulatory exposure, remediation</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Reputational Harm</td><td>Offensive outputs, public backlash, media attention</td><td>Public response, disable if needed, stakeholder communication</td><td>Cause, affected parties, brand impact</td></tr>
</table>

<h2>Incident Severity Classification</h2>
<div class="code-block">
<pre><code># AI Incident Severity Matrix

P0 - CRITICAL (Response Time: Immediate)
Impact: Severe harm, data breach, regulatory violation, safety risk
Examples:
- PII of 1,000+ customers leaked
- Discriminatory decisions affecting protected class
- AI system causing physical harm
- Material regulatory violation
Actions:
- Disable system immediately
- Notify CEO, Legal, Board within 1 hour
- Activate crisis management team
- Prepare regulatory notifications (72 hours for GDPR)

P1 - HIGH (Response Time: 1 hour)
Impact: Significant accuracy degradation, bias detected, security vulnerability
Examples:
- Accuracy drops from 95% to 85%
- Bias metrics exceed tolerance (disparate impact > 1.25)
- Successful prompt injection attack
- Unauthorized access to AI system
Actions:
- Assess scope and impact
- Notify Model Owner, AI Governance, Security
- Implement temporary mitigations
- Begin root cause analysis

P2 - MEDIUM (Response Time: 4 hours)
Impact: Performance issues, user complaints, cost overruns
Examples:
- Increased error rate or latency
- Multiple user complaints about quality
- Daily cost exceeds budget by 50%
- Documentation or compliance gaps
Actions:
- Investigate and document
- Notify Model Owner and Product Manager
- Plan remediation
- Update stakeholders

P3 - LOW (Response Time: 24 hours)
Impact: Minor issues, best practice deviations
Examples:
- Isolated incorrect response
- Documentation outdated
- Minor policy deviation
- Training overdue
Actions:
- Log incident
- Schedule fix in normal workflow
- Update documentation</code></pre>

<h2>Incident Response Workflow</h2>
<div class="code-block">
<pre><code># 7-Step AI Incident Response Process

STEP 1: DETECT (0-15 minutes)
- Automated alerts trigger
- User reports issue
- Audit discovers problem
→ Create incident ticket, assign severity

STEP 2: TRIAGE (15-60 minutes)
- Assess severity and impact
- Identify affected stakeholders
- Determine if system should be disabled
- Assemble response team
→ Update incident ticket, notify stakeholders

STEP 3: CONTAIN (1-4 hours)
- Disable system if necessary
- Implement temporary mitigations
- Prevent further harm
- Preserve evidence (logs, data, configurations)
→ Document containment actions

STEP 4: INVESTIGATE (1-7 days)
- Root cause analysis
- Review logs and metrics
- Interview stakeholders
- Assess full scope of impact
→ Create investigation report

STEP 5: REMEDIATE (1-30 days)
- Fix root cause
- Update model, data, or controls
- Test solution thoroughly
- Obtain approval to re-enable
→ Document fix and testing

STEP 6: COMMUNICATE (Ongoing)
- Notify affected users
- Update internal stakeholders
- Regulatory notifications if required
- Public statement if needed
→ Communication log

STEP 7: LEARN (Within 30 days)
- Post-incident review meeting
- Document lessons learned
- Update policies and procedures
- Implement preventive measures
→ Lessons learned document, policy updates</code></pre>

<h2>Post-Incident Review Template</h2>
<div class="code-block">
<pre><code># Post-Incident Review (PIR)

## Incident Summary
- Incident ID: INC-AI-2024-042
- Date/Time: March 15, 2024, 14:30 UTC
- Severity: P1 (High)
- Duration: 3 hours 45 minutes
- Systems Affected: Customer Support Chatbot v2.1

## What Happened
Timeline of events:
14:30 - Automated alert: Accuracy dropped to 82%
14:35 - Model Owner notified, began investigation
14:50 - Root cause identified: Stale knowledge base
15:15 - Decision to disable chatbot, fallback to human agents
15:30 - Knowledge base refresh initiated
17:45 - Testing completed, chatbot re-enabled
18:15 - Accuracy restored to 96%

## Impact Assessment
- Users affected: ~500 customers received suboptimal responses
- Business impact: 3.75 hours of reduced chatbot availability
- Financial impact: $2,500 (human agent costs)
- Reputational impact: 12 customer complaints, no media attention
- Regulatory impact: None

## Root Cause Analysis
Primary cause: Knowledge base update process failed silently
Contributing factors:
- No alerting on knowledge base staleness
- Manual update process prone to human error
- Insufficient testing of knowledge base updates

## What Went Well
✓ Automated accuracy monitoring detected issue quickly
✓ Response team assembled within 15 minutes
✓ Clear decision-making on disabling system
✓ Effective communication with support team
✓ Fallback to human agents worked smoothly

## What Went Wrong
✗ Knowledge base update failure went undetected for 6 hours
✗ No automated rollback mechanism
✗ Incident response plan didn't cover this scenario
✗ Delayed notification to Product Manager

## Lessons Learned
1. Automate knowledge base updates with validation
2. Implement alerting on data staleness
3. Add automated rollback for accuracy drops
4. Update incident response plan with this scenario
5. Improve notification procedures

## Action Items
| Action | Owner | Due Date | Status |
|--------|-------|----------|--------|
| Automate KB updates | DevOps | Apr 1 | In Progress |
| Add staleness alerts | Model Owner | Mar 22 | Complete |
| Implement auto-rollback | Engineering | Apr 15 | Planned |
| Update IR plan | AI Governance | Mar 20 | Complete |
| Improve notifications | Model Owner | Mar 18 | Complete |

## Prevention Measures
- Automated knowledge base updates with validation
- Alerting on data staleness (>24 hours)
- Automated rollback if accuracy drops >5%
- Enhanced testing for knowledge base changes</code></pre>

<h2>Building a Learning Culture</h2>
<p>Effective governance requires organizational learning:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Blameless Post-Mortems:</strong> Focus on systems and processes, not individuals</li>
    <li><strong>Share Lessons Learned:</strong> Distribute PIRs across teams, create knowledge base</li>
    <li><strong>Celebrate Improvements:</strong> Recognize teams that enhance governance</li>
    <li><strong>Encourage Reporting:</strong> Reward early detection of issues, no punishment for raising concerns</li>
    <li><strong>Cross-Team Collaboration:</strong> Regular forums for sharing experiences and best practices</li>
    <li><strong>External Learning:</strong> Participate in industry groups, learn from others' incidents</li>
</ul>
