<h1>Threat Modeling and Risk Assessment for AI Systems</h1>

<h2>Introduction to AI Threat Modeling</h2>
<p>Threat modeling is a structured approach to identifying, quantifying, and prioritizing potential security threats to a system. For AI systems, threat modeling must account for unique attack surfaces and failure modes that don't exist in traditional software. This section explores frameworks and methodologies specifically adapted for generative AI risk assessment.</p>

<p>Traditional threat modeling frameworks like STRIDE (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege) provide a foundation, but AI systems require additional considerations around model behavior, training data integrity, and emergent risks. Organizations must adopt hybrid approaches that combine established security frameworks with AI-specific threat taxonomies.</p>

<h2>The AI Attack Surface</h2>
<p>Understanding the complete attack surface is essential for comprehensive threat modeling. AI systems present multiple layers where adversaries can intervene:</p>

<h3>1. Training Phase Attack Surface</h3>
<p>Attacks targeting the model before deployment:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data Poisoning:</strong> Injecting malicious examples into training data to influence model behavior</li>
<li><strong>Backdoor Insertion:</strong> Embedding hidden triggers that activate specific behaviors when encountered</li>
<li><strong>Model Theft:</strong> Stealing model weights or architecture through unauthorized access</li>
<li><strong>Supply Chain Attacks:</strong> Compromising pre-trained models, datasets, or training infrastructure</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Inference Phase Attack Surface</h3>
<p>Attacks targeting deployed models during operation:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prompt Injection:</strong> Malicious instructions in user inputs or external data sources</li>
<li><strong>Adversarial Examples:</strong> Carefully crafted inputs designed to cause misclassification</li>
<li><strong>Model Inversion:</strong> Extracting training data or sensitive information through queries</li>
<li><strong>Membership Inference:</strong> Determining whether specific data was used in training</li>
<li><strong>Jailbreaking:</strong> Bypassing safety filters and content policies</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Integration Layer Attack Surface</h3>
<p>Attacks targeting the systems surrounding the AI model:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>API Exploitation:</strong> Abusing rate limits, authentication, or access controls</li>
<li><strong>Context Manipulation:</strong> Injecting malicious content into retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) sources</li>
<li><strong>Plugin/Tool Abuse:</strong> Exploiting AI agents' ability to call external functions</li>
<li><strong>Logging and Monitoring Evasion:</strong> Crafting attacks that avoid detection systems</li>
</ul>

<h2>Threat Modeling Frameworks for AI</h2>

<h3>ATLAS Framework (Adversarial Threat Landscape for AI Systems)</h3>
<p>Developed by MITRE, ATLAS provides a knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques specific to machine learning systems. The framework organizes threats into categories:</p>

<table>

<h3>OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications</h3>
<p>The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) has developed a top 10 list of critical vulnerabilities specific to LLM applications:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>LLM01: Prompt Injection</strong> - Manipulating LLM behavior through crafted inputs</li>
<li><strong>LLM02: Insecure Output Handling</strong> - Insufficient validation of LLM outputs before downstream use</li>
<li><strong>LLM03: Training Data Poisoning</strong> - Tampering with training data to introduce vulnerabilities</li>
<li><strong>LLM04: Model Denial of Service</strong> - Resource exhaustion through expensive queries</li>
<li><strong>LLM05: Supply Chain Vulnerabilities</strong> - Compromised components, datasets, or pre-trained models</li>
<li><strong>LLM06: Sensitive Information Disclosure</strong> - Leaking confidential data through model outputs</li>
<li><strong>LLM07: Insecure Plugin Design</strong> - Vulnerabilities in LLM extensions and integrations</li>
<li><strong>LLM08: Excessive Agency</strong> - Granting LLMs too much autonomy or permissions</li>
<li><strong>LLM09: Overreliance</strong> - Trusting LLM outputs without verification</li>
<li><strong>LLM10: Model Theft</strong> - Unauthorized access to proprietary models</li>
</ol>

<h2>Risk Assessment Methodology</h2>
<p>Once threats are identified, they must be assessed for likelihood and impact to prioritize mitigation efforts.</p>

<h3>Likelihood Assessment</h3>
<p>Factors influencing the probability of successful exploitation:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Attack Complexity:</strong> Technical skill and resources required (low, medium, high)</li>
<li><strong>Attack Vector:</strong> How accessible is the attack surface (network, local, physical)</li>
<li><strong>Privileges Required:</strong> What level of access is needed (none, low, high)</li>
<li><strong>User Interaction:</strong> Does the attack require victim participation</li>
<li><strong>Exploit Availability:</strong> Are tools or techniques publicly available</li>
</ul>

<h3>Impact Assessment</h3>
<p>Potential consequences if the threat is realized:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Confidentiality Impact:</strong> Exposure of sensitive information (none, low, high)</li>
<li><strong>Integrity Impact:</strong> Corruption of data or system behavior (none, low, high)</li>
<li><strong>Availability Impact:</strong> Service disruption or denial (none, low, high)</li>
<li><strong>Safety Impact:</strong> Potential for physical or psychological harm</li>
<li><strong>Reputational Impact:</strong> Damage to organizational trust and brand</li>
<li><strong>Regulatory Impact:</strong> Compliance violations and legal consequences</li>
</ul>

<h3>Risk Scoring Matrix</h3>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Likelihood / Impact</th>
<th>Low Impact</th>

<tr>
<td><strong>Medium Likelihood</strong></td>
<td>Low Risk</td>
<td>Medium Risk</td>
<td>High Risk</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Low Likelihood</strong></td>
<td>Low Risk</td>
<td>Low Risk</td>
<td>Medium Risk</td>

</ul>

<h3>Continuous Threat Modeling</h3>
<p>Establish a cadence for threat model reviews:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quarterly reviews to incorporate new threat intelligence</li>
