<h1>AI Red Teaming - Adversarial Testing for GenAI Systems</h1>

<div class="intro-section">
<h2>Course Overview</h2>
<p>Welcome to <strong>AI Red Teaming - Adversarial Testing for GenAI Systems</strong>. As generative AI systems become increasingly integrated into critical business operations, the need for rigorous security testing has never been more important. This comprehensive course equips you with the theoretical foundations, methodologies, and strategic frameworks necessary to identify, assess, and mitigate vulnerabilities in AI systems.</p>

<p>AI red teaming represents a paradigm shift from traditional cybersecurity testing. While conventional penetration testing focuses on exploiting technical vulnerabilities in software and infrastructure, AI red teaming addresses unique challenges including prompt injection attacks, model alignment failures, bias exploitation, data leakage, and adversarial manipulation. This course provides enterprise-level training suitable for security professionals, AI practitioners, risk managers, and compliance officers.</p>

<h2>Purpose and Relevance</h2>
<p>The deployment of large language models (LLMs) and generative AI systems in production environments introduces novel security risks that traditional security frameworks cannot adequately address. Organizations face challenges including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Safety Bypasses:</strong> Attackers circumventing content filters to generate harmful, illegal, or unethical outputs</li>
<li><strong>Prompt Injection:</strong> Malicious instructions embedded in user inputs or external data sources that override system behavior</li>
<li><strong>Data Exfiltration:</strong> Extraction of sensitive training data, system prompts, or personally identifiable information (PII)</li>
<li><strong>Bias Amplification:</strong> Exploitation of model biases leading to discriminatory or unfair outcomes</li>
<li><strong>Hallucination Exploitation:</strong> Triggering confident but factually incorrect responses that undermine trust</li>
</ul>

<p>This course addresses these challenges by providing a structured approach to adversarial testing, enabling organizations to proactively identify weaknesses before malicious actors exploit them. The methodologies taught here are aligned with emerging industry standards from organizations including NIST, OWASP, and the AI Risk Management Framework.</p>

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
<p>Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand the fundamental principles and unique characteristics of AI red teaming compared to traditional security testing</li>
<li>Identify and categorize common attack vectors targeting generative AI systems including jailbreaks, prompt injections, and adversarial inputs</li>
<li>Design and execute comprehensive red team assessments using structured methodologies and threat modeling frameworks</li>
<li>Implement automated testing frameworks and leverage open-source tools for continuous vulnerability scanning</li>
<li>Evaluate defense mechanisms including input filtering, output validation, guardrails, and constitutional AI approaches</li>
<li>Establish continuous red teaming programs integrated with CI/CD pipelines and production monitoring</li>
<li>Assess the effectiveness of AI safety measures and recommend remediation strategies</li>
<li>Communicate findings effectively to technical and non-technical stakeholders including executives and compliance teams</li>
</ul>
