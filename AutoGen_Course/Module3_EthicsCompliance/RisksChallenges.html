</tr>
</table>

<h3>2. Algorithmic Bias and Discrimination</h3>
<p><strong>Risk:</strong> AI systems trained on biased data perpetuate or amplify discrimination against people with disabilities.</p>

<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Hiring AI that screens out candidates with employment gaps (common for people with disabilities)</li>
<li>Credit scoring AI that penalizes disability-related financial patterns</li>
<li>Healthcare AI that provides lower quality recommendations for people with disabilities</li>
<li>Content moderation AI that removes disability-related content as "inappropriate"</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Mitigation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Audit training data for representation and bias</li>
<li>Test AI systems for disparate impact on people with disabilities</li>
<li>Include disability expertise in AI development teams</li>
<li>Implement fairness constraints in model training</li>
<li>Provide transparency about AI decision-making</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Accessibility Feature Failures</h3>
<p><strong>Risk:</strong> AI-powered accessibility features may fail or provide poor-quality output.</p>

<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Auto-generated captions with high error rates</li>
<li>AI-generated alt text that is inaccurate or misleading</li>
<li>Voice assistants that misunderstand commands</li>
<li>Automatic translations that lose meaning</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Impact:</strong> Users may receive incorrect information, miss critical content, or lose trust in accessibility features.</p>

<p><strong>Mitigation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Clearly label AI-generated content as such</li>
<li>Provide confidence scores or quality indicators</li>
<li>Allow human review and correction</li>
<li>Continuously improve AI quality</li>
<li>Provide fallback options when AI fails</li>
</ul>

<h3>4. Dependency and Single Points of Failure</h3>
<p><strong>Risk:</strong> Over-reliance on AI accessibility features creates vulnerability when systems fail.</p>

<p><strong>Scenarios:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Network outage disables cloud-based AI accessibility features</li>
<li>AI service provider discontinues accessibility API</li>
<li>AI model update introduces accessibility regressions</li>
<li>Cost constraints lead to reduced AI accessibility features</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Mitigation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Provide offline fallback options</li>
<li>Don't rely solely on AI for critical accessibility features</li>
<li>Maintain non-AI accessibility alternatives</li>
<li>Test accessibility after AI updates</li>
<li>Have contingency plans for AI service disruptions</li>
</ul>

<h2>Social and Ethical Risks</h2>

<h3>1. Privacy and Surveillance Concerns</h3>
<p><strong>Risk:</strong> AI accessibility features may require collecting sensitive disability-related data.</p>

<p><strong>Concerns:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Disability status disclosure may lead to discrimination</li>
<li>Personalization data could be misused or breached</li>
<li>Assistive technology usage patterns reveal private information</li>
<li>AI monitoring for accessibility may enable surveillance</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Mitigation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Minimize data collection to what's necessary</li>
<li>Provide clear privacy controls and consent</li>
<li>Anonymize and encrypt disability-related data</li>
<li>Allow accessibility features without data collection when possible</li>
<li>Be transparent about data usage</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Autonomy and Agency Reduction</h3>
<p><strong>Risk:</strong> AI systems may reduce user autonomy by making decisions for users with disabilities.</p>

<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<ul>

<li>Predictive systems that limit options based on disability assumptions</li>
<li>AI assistants that override user preferences "for their own good"</li>
<li>Automated accommodations that users didn't request</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Mitigation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Always provide user control over AI behavior</li>
<li>Make AI assistance opt-in, not automatic</li>
<li>Allow users to override AI decisions</li>
<li>Respect user preferences and choices</li>
<li>Avoid paternalistic design</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Digital Divide and Inequality</h3>
<p><strong>Risk:</strong> Advanced AI accessibility features may only be available to privileged users.</p>

<p><strong>Factors:</strong></p>

<li>Cost of AI-powered assistive technology</li>
<li>Device and connectivity requirements</li>
<li>Digital literacy barriers</li>
<li>Geographic availability of AI services</li>
<li>Language and cultural limitations</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Mitigation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Provide free or low-cost AI accessibility features</li>
<li>Ensure AI works on lower-end devices</li>
<li>Support offline functionality</li>
<li>Expand language and cultural coverage</li>
<li>Partner with disability organizations to reach underserved communities</li>
</ul>

<h3>4. Dehumanization and Stigma</h3>
<p><strong>Risk:</strong> AI-mediated interactions may feel impersonal or reinforce disability stigma.</p>

<p><strong>Concerns:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Users with disabilities relegated to AI-only support channels</li>
<li>AI-generated accessibility features perceived as "lesser" than human-created</li>
<li>Disability portrayed as problem to be "fixed" by AI</li>
<li>Loss of human connection in accessibility services</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Mitigation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure equal access to human support</li>
<li>Frame AI as augmenting, not replacing, human accessibility work</li>
<li>Use respectful, empowering language in AI interactions</li>
<li>Maintain human oversight and intervention options</li>
</ul>
