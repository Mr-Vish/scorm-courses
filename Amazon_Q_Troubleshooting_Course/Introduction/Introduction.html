<h1>Amazon Q for AWS Troubleshooting and Optimization</h1>

<div class="intro-section">
<p>Welcome to <strong>Amazon Q for AWS Troubleshooting and Optimization</strong>. This comprehensive course is designed to transform how you interact with AWS services by leveraging Amazon Q, a generative AI-powered assistant. You will learn to diagnose complex issues, optimize infrastructure for cost and security, and accelerate your development workflow using natural language interactions.</p>

<h2>Course Overview</h2>
<p>In the rapidly evolving landscape of cloud computing, the ability to quickly resolve issues and optimize resources is paramount. Amazon Q brings the power of generative AI directly into the AWS Console and your IDE, acting as an expert partner. This course moves beyond basic chat interactions to explore deep troubleshooting methodologies, advanced optimization strategies, and best practices for integrating AI assistance into your daily operations.</p>

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
<p>By the end of this course, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Master Amazon Q Fundamentals:</strong> Understand the architecture, capabilities, and context-awareness of Amazon Q across the AWS Console and IDEs.</li>
    <li><strong>Diagnose & Resolve Issues:</strong> specific techniques to troubleshoot network connectivity, permission errors, and application failures using Q's analysis capabilities.</li>
    <li><strong>Optimize Infrastructure:</strong> Leverage Q to identify cost-saving opportunities, security vulnerabilities, and performance bottlenecks.</li>
    <li><strong>Accelerate Development:</strong> Use Q for code generation, explanation, and upgrading legacy applications (e.g., Java version upgrades).</li>
    <li><strong>Navigate Limitations:</strong> Critically evaluate AI responses and understand the boundaries of generative AI in critical infrastructure management.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>This course is intended for:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Cloud Engineers & Architects:</strong> Who need to maintain and optimize AWS infrastructure.</li>
    <li><strong>DevOps Professionals:</strong> Who require rapid troubleshooting and incident response tools.</li>
    <li><strong>Software Developers:</strong> Who build applications on AWS and want to leverage AI for coding assistance.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>To maximize the value of this course, learners should have:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Basic familiarity with core AWS services (EC2, S3, Lambda, VPC, IAM).</li>
    <li>General understanding of cloud infrastructure concepts.</li>
    <li>Access to an AWS account (for following along with examples, though not strictly required).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Course Structure</h2>
<p>The course is organized into three core modules, each followed by an assessment to reinforce learning:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Module 1: Amazon Q Fundamentals</strong> - Architecture, capabilities, and setup.</li>
    <li><strong>Module 2: Advanced Troubleshooting</strong> - Diagnostic workflows and log analysis.</li>
    <li><strong>Module 3: Optimization & Best Practices</strong> - Security, cost, and code modernization.</li>
</ol>
<p>We will conclude with a comprehensive <strong>Final Assessment</strong>.</p>

<h2>How to Navigate</h2>
